His nickname comes from the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of San Juan de la Pea (c 1370) which says that "they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn't as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles" (clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas veni)
