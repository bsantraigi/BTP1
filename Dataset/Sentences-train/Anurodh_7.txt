Director Shakti Samanta said that although the film had an "interesting story" he felt that audiences didn't want to accept the leading man Rajesh Khanna doing romantic scenes with his real-life wife Dimple Kapadia's sister Simple Kapadia and this is the reason this film was just a superhit otherwise it would have been a bigger blockbuster
