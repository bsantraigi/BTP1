Alstom (originally as Alsthom) was formed from a merger between Compagnie Franaise Thomson Houston and the Socit Alsacienne de Constructions Mcaniques in 1928; significant acquisitions included the Constructions Electriques de France (1932) shipbuilder Chantiers de l'Atlantique (1976) and parts of ACEC SA (Belgium late 1980s)
