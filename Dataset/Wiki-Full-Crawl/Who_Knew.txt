"Who Knew" is a song by American singer Pink from her fourth studio album I'm Not Dead (2006). Written by Pink, Max Martin and Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald, the song was originally released on May 18, 2006, by the LaFace label to radio as the album's second single, but was only a moderate success. After the success of "U + Ur Hand", the song was later successfully re-released in June 2007 as the album's fourth single in the United States. Musically, "Who Knew" is a pop song. Lyrically, it is regarding the loss of a good friend of hers.
Upon its release, "Who Knew" was well received by music critics, who acclaimed it as a solid song on the album and lauded the lyrical content. It faced comparisons for having similarities with Kelly Clarkson's 2004 single "Since U Been Gone", also written by Martin and Dr. Luke. The song was commercially successful worldwide, where it peaked in the top five in countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and component charts in the United States. In addition, the song is also Pink's longest chart runner on the Hot 100, spending 36 weeks before dropping out. "Who Knew" became one of the songs that helped propel Pink's popularity in the United States, following her decline between 2003 and 2005. The song was later certified Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
The accompanying music video to the song was directed by Dragon and was released in May 2006, where it shows Pink singing at a county fair, with a storyline about two young lovers who end up being separated after the man begins using drugs. The song has been performed on many of Pink's world tours, including I'm Not Dead Tour, Funhouse Tour and its extension tour Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour. As her personal favorite, the song was eventually included in Pink's debut compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!!! (2010) which was released by Jive Records.
