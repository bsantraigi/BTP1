Shane Anthony Belcourt (born December 30, 1972) is a Mtis writer, director, and cinematographer living and working in Canada. He is best known for his feature film Tkaronto, which depicts the life of urban Mtis and First Nations people.
The film was reviewed by Jason Anderson at Eye Weekly, who wrote "The quality of writer-director Shane Belcourt's feature debut  named after our city's original Mohawk name  is all the more remarkable when you consider that it was made in six months on a measly budget of $20,000. Based on Belcourt's experience as the son of a Mtis father, the movie portrays the crises of Jolene and Ray (Duane Murray), two thirtysomethings who can't figure out a way to square up their urban lifestyles and material ambitions with what an elder (played by Lorne Cardinal) calls blood memory. But for all of Tkaronto's heavy themes, the film has a sense of lightness that makes it one of the year's most appealing local indie features."
