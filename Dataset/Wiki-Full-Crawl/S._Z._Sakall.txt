Szke Szakll (born Grtner Sndor, 2 February 1883  12 February 1955), known in the English speaking world as S. Z. Sakall, was a Hungarian stage and film character actor. The name he went by, Szke Szakll, is Hungarian for blonde beard. He appeared in many films including Christmas in Connecticut (1945), In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Lullaby of Broadway (1951), and Casablanca (1942), in which he played Carl, the head waiter. 
Chubby-jowled Sakall played numerous supporting roles in Hollywood musicals and comedies in the 1940s and 1950s. His rotund cuteness caused studio head Jack Warner to bestow on Sakall the nickname "Cuddles". Warner asked that he be billed as S. Z. "Cuddles" Sakall in his later films, though he was never happy with the name. He became well known for using the phrase "everything is hunky dunky".
