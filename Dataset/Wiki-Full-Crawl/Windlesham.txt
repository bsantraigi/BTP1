Windlesham is a village in the Surrey Heath borough of Surrey, England and civil parish that covers Bagshot and Lightwater in the same borough. Its name derives from the Windle Brook which runs south of the village into Chobham and the common suffix 'ham', the Old English word for 'homestead'.
Today Windlesham has a main clustered community with various clubs.  The main public parkland is linked by footpath across the M3 motorway cutting across the south of the parish, Windlesham Arboretum.  Passing through its north is the A30 (London Road), two nearby train stations and Heathrow Airport make the settlement economically largely a commuter village. It has one church, St John the Baptist, the Windlesham Club and Theatre and six public houses.
A few large companies of late-20th-century origin have based themselves in Windlesham, including Rainbow Play Systems and the Linde Group.
