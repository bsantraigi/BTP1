Who I Am is the first album by singer Amy Pearson released by Sony BMG in Australia on 19 April 2008 (see 2008 in music). Although the album was planned for release in November 2007, it had been pushed back due to the releases of Delta Goodrem's and Kylie Minogue's albums during the same time.  However the album was released in China around the original release date. It has so far released 3 singles in Australia without the help of the album release, "Don't Miss You", "Not Me" and "Ready to Fly". All three have received moderate airtime on Australian mainstream radio stations.
