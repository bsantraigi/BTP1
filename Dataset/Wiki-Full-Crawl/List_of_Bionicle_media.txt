Aside from the toys in the Lego Bionicle franchise, Lego has also marketed an ongoing book series, several video games (mostly for the Game Boy Advance), and four computer-animated movies which feature important plot points.  A Bionicle comic book was also published by DC Comics and made available free to members of the Lego Club. Some issues were also posted on the official Bionicle website, Bionicle.com.  There are also various other ancillary products available, such as watches, toothbrushes, and backpacks, as well as online adventure games.  Much of the additional content for the original series that was originally available on the now inactive official websites Bionicle.com and BionicleStory.com is now available on an unofficial website called BioMedia Project.
