Henry I of Cyprus, nicknamed the Fat (French: Henri de Lusignan; 3 May 1217  18 January 1253 at Nicosia) was King of Cyprus from 1218 to 1253. He was the son of Hugh I of Cyprus and Alice of Champagne. When his father Hugh I died on January 10, 1218, the 8-month-old Henry became king. His mother was the official regent, but handed off the actual governing to her uncle, Philip of Ibelin.  When Philip died, the effective regency passed to his brother, John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut.
