Floridays is the fifteenth album by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett.  It was released in June 1986 as MCA 5730 and was produced by Coral Reefer Band member Michael Utley.  The title of the album is taken from the 1941 poetry collection of the same name by Don Blanding. The album marks the end of Buffett's shift toward a more country sound that characterized his previous two releases and a return to a sound closer to that of his late 1970s and early 1980s output.  The album features a wider variety of musical instruments than was typical for Buffett's previous works, notably several songs with strings and horns.  His daughter Savannah Jane Buffett is credited for playing mini-conga on the album.
It was also his last studio album to feature Jimmy Buffett's trademark mustache, before he shaved it off for the next album Hot Water in 1988.
