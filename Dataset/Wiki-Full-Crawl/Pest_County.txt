It covers an area of 6,393.14 square kilometres (2,468.41 sq mi), and has a population of 1,213,090 (2009). It surrounds  the national capital Budapest and the majority of the county's population (65.2%/790,995 in 2009) live in the suburbs of Budapest. It shares borders with Slovakia and the Hungarian counties Ngrd, Heves, Jsz-Nagykun-Szolnok, Bcs-Kiskun, Fejr, and Komrom-Esztergom. The River Danube flows through the county. The capital of Pest County is Budapest (administratively separate), but it is planned to completely separate the capital from the county at least until 2020, as it loses catch-up aids from the European Union because of the high development of Budapest.
