WHKO (99.1 FM, "K99.1") is a country music radio station licensed to Dayton, Ohio.  The station is owned by Cox Media Group.  With its 50,000 watt signal, WHKO is one of the strongest FM stations in the Southwestern Ohio area, and frequently makes mention of this during on-air promos.  Its studios are co-located with the Dayton Daily News, WHIO-AM-FM-TV and two more radio stations in the Cox Media Center building near downtown Dayton.  WHKO has a transmitter in Dayton's westside.
K99.1FM plays a mix of "New country and your familiar favorites" and has historically played more music and fewer commercials than most radio stations in the Dayton/Cincinnati radio market.  With a strong signal and a commitment to playing more music than the competition, WHKO has a long history of being near the top of the Dayton Arbitron ratings since it began its country format in March 1989.  K99.1 also shows up regularly in the Cincinnati Arbitron ratings, as its signal comes in clear throughout the greater Cincinnati market as well.
