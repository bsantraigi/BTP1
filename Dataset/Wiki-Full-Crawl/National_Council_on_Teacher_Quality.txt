The National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) is a think tank founded in 2000 and based in Washington, D.C. that advocates for tougher evaluations of classroom teachers. It is primarily known for its Teacher Prep Review, a report released in June 2013 that found American teacher education programs largely inadequate.
