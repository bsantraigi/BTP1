The Tuvans or Tuvinians (Tuvan: , Tvalar; Mongolian: , Tuva) are an indigenous people of Siberia/Central Asia. They speak Tuvan, a Turkic language. They are also regarded in Mongolia as one of the Uriankhai peoples.Tuvans have historically been cattle-herding nomads, tending to herds of goats, sheep, camels, reindeer, cattle and yaks for the past thousands of years.  They have traditionally lived in yurts covered by felt or chums covered with birch bark or hide that they relocate seasonally as they move to newer pastures. Traditionally, the Tuvans were divided into nine regions called khoshuun, namely the Tozhu, Salchak, Oyunnar, Khemchik, Khaasuut, Shalyk, Nibazy, Daavan and Choodu, and Beezi. The first four were ruled by Uriankhai Mongol princes, while the rest were administered by Borjigin Mongol princes.
