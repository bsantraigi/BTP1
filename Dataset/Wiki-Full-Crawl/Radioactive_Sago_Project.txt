Radioactive Sago Project is a Filipino jazz rock band formed in 1999 in Quezon City, Philippines. The band's sound is a fusion of spoken-word poetry, bebop jazz, and punk. Subjects in their material range from politics, drugs, alcohol, random musings and current issues.
Fronted by award-winning poet Lourd de Veyra, the band has released four albums. The first, a self-titled album, was released under Viva Records in 2000. This was followed by Urban Gulaman in 2004 and Tangina Mo Andaming Nagugutom sa Mundo Fashionista Ka Pa Rin in 2007 and Ang Itlog at ang Demonyo in 2014, all under Terno recordings.
