Segundo Vctor Aurelio Chomn y Ruiz  (also Chomont or Chaumont, French: [om]; 17 October 1871  2 May 1929) was a pioneering Spanish film director, cinematographer and screenwriter. He produced many short films in France while working for Path Frres and has been compared to Georges Mlis, due to his frequent camera tricks and optical illusions. He is regarded as the most significant Spanish silent film director in an international context.
