STX Europe AS, formerly Aker Yards ASA, was until 2012 a subsidiary of the South Korean STX Offshore & Shipbuilding.
With headquarters in Oslo, Norway, STX Europe operated 15 shipyards in Brazil, Finland, France, Norway, Romania and Vietnam.  The company had three business areas: Cruise & Ferries, Offshore & Specialized Vessels and Other Operations.
In 2012, with rising outstanding debts, STX retained the Finnish cruise shipbuilding yard and sold the remainder as STX OSV Holdings, (Offshore & Specialist Vessels), including all the yards, to Fincantieri, which renamed the group Vard.
In September 2014 STX Finland was sold, 70% to Meyer Werft and 30% to the Finnish government. The operations were continued under name Meyer Turku thereafter. Meyer Werft acquired the Finnish government's 30% in April 2015.
In 2017 STX France, after the bankruptcy of STX Corporation, was partly acquired by Italian shipyard Fincantieri (50%) and was renamed again Chantiers de l'Atlantique.
