KSFM (102.5 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station serving the Sacramento, California market with a rhythmic contemporary radio format. Its city of license and transmitter are located in Woodland in Yolo County, but the studios and offices are at 5345 Madison Avenue in Sacramento. KSFM is owned by Entercom, which also owns Sacramento-area stations KIFM, KKDO, KRXQ, KSEG, and KUDL.
KSFM's previous slogan was "Sacramento's #1 Station for Hip-Hop and R&B" from 2006 to 2010, when it changed its slogan to just "1025" with a broadened mix of R&B, hip hop, and rhythmic pop music. Entercom bills KSFM as a rhythmic top 40 station due to its multicultural listenership.
