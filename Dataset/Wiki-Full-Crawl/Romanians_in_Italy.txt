Romanians in Italy became a notable presence mostly after 1999, due to a large wave of emigration known in Romania as Fenomenul migraiei ctre UE (Movement to the EU Phenomenon). 80% of the emigrants went to Spain or Italy, whose national languages are related to Romanian. They were followed by a further wave beginning in 2002, when Romanian citizens obtained the right to leave their country and go to any Schengen Zone country without having a visa. As of  2015, there were 1,131,839 Romanian citizens with additional 150,021 Moldovans living in Italy.
