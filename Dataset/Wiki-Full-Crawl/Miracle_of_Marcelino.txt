Miracle of Marcelino (Spanish: Marcelino, pan y vino, "Marcelino, bread and wine") is a 1955 Spanish film. It was a success, and other countries have produced versions of it. The 1955 film was written by Jos Maria Sanchez-Silva, who based it on his novel, and directed by Ladislao Vajda. Its stars were Rafael Rivelles, Juan Calvo (who also starred together as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's Don Quixote and the young child star Pablito Calvo (no relation to Juan) as Marcelino. The musical score and theme song - sung in full during the action, rather than at the start of the film - are by Pablo Sorozbal.
The story, revised and modernised in both the book and film, dates back to a medieval legend, one of many gathered together in a volume by Alfonso el Sabio.
