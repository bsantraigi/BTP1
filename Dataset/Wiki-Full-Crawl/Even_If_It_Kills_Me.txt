Even if It Kills Me is the third studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Ric Ocasek, Adam Schlesinger and Eli Janney, the album was released on September 18, 2007, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, made a breakthrough with their second album, Commit This to Memory, garnering praise and independent buzz upon its 2005 release. Following the release, the band toured relentlessly over the next two years, during which time frontman Justin Pierre struggled with alcohol and substance abuse. These addictions were infused into the writing process of Even If Kills Me, which was recorded in early 2007 Stratosphere Studios in Chelsea and the legendary Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village.
The album debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and number one on the magazine's Independent Albums chart, representing a career best at the time. "Broken Heart" and "This Is for Real" were the album's first two singles. The album received largely favorable reviews from music critics; Spin called the set "near-perfect pop," while The New York Times described it as "one long sugar rush."
