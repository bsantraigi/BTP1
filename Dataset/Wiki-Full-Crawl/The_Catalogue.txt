The Catalogue (German: Der Katalog) is a box set consisting of eight albums by German electronic music band Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums are digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album's original release.

Due to licensing issues, three of these albumsComputer World, Electric Cafe (now re-christened with its original working title of Techno Pop) and The Mixare unavailable in the United States except as part of the boxed set (although they can now be purchased digitally via the iTunes Store). The Techno Pop album contains a slightly revised track listing from its predecessor Electric Cafe: the song "The Telephone Call" now appears in its much shorter single mix, and that single's B-side remix, "House Phone", has been added as a proper album track.
