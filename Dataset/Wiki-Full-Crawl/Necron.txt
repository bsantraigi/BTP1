In the fictional universe of Warhammer 40,000, the Necrons are a race and a playable army in the tabletop miniatures wargame.  They are an ancient race of skeleton-like robots (inspired by the Terminator robots from the movie franchise) who are awakening from an aeons-long slumber and fighting to reclaim the galaxy from the younger races. The Necrons are analogous to the Undead in Warhammer Fantasy Battle, particularly the Tomb Kings of Khemri with their hordes of skeletons.
