Srirangam (Thiruvarangam in Tamil) is an island and a part of the city of Tiruchirappalli (heart of Tamil Nadu), in South India.
Srirangam is bounded by the Kaveri River (also known as Cauvery river) on one side, and the Kaveri distributary Kollidam (Coleroon) on the other side. Srirangam is home to a significant population of Srivaishnavites (followers of Lord Vishnu).
