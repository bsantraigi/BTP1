The Moth Confesses is the 1969 debut album by The Neon Philharmonic.  Described as "A Phonograph Opera," it was inspired, according to the liner notes, by a production of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra, which Saussy attended after The New York Times claimed that it was a terrible opera, and wanted to see what a terrible opera looked like, which he surmised was its deliberate attempt to appeal to a one-time audience.  In response, he conceived this album as a condensed opera, with a moth-like protagonist, focused on the "literary theme" of desperation.  Saussy did not imagine it could be staged like Tommy, but offered it up as a challenge."Brilliant Colors" and "Morning Girl" were both released as singles, while "The New Life Out There" was used to promote the record as a contemporary opera in radio advertisements.  "Morning Girl" hit #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was later covered by The Lettermen.  Shaun Cassidy covered "Morning Girl, Later" with a few tweaked lyrics (omitting the reference to "Catherine" which complicates the song, implying that the protagonist now has a wife or daughter) and titled it "Morning, Girl."  The songs primarily cover the topic of striking out towards a new life when relationships fail for various reasons.
