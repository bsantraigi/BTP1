The Reverend Francis Charles Robert Jourdain M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. (4 March 1865  27 February 1940), was a notable British amateur ornithologist and oologist.  He was primarily known for his extensive research into the breeding biology of the birds of the Palaearctic region. He also had interests in the food of British birds and their geographical distribution and strongly encouraged detailed and accurate record keeping in local ornithology. He was a founder of the British Oological Association, which changed its name after his death to the Jourdain Society in his memory.
