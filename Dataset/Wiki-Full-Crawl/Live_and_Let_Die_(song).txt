"Live and Let Die" is the main theme song of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings. It was the most successful Bond theme to that point, charting at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart.Commissioned specifically for the movie, it reunited the former Beatle with the band's producer, George Martin, who produced the song and arranged the orchestra. It has been covered by several bands, with the Guns N' Roses version being the most popular cover. Both the McCartney and the Guns N' Roses versions were nominated for Grammy Awards. In 2012, McCartney was awarded the Million-Air Award from Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), for more than 4 million performances of the song in the US.
