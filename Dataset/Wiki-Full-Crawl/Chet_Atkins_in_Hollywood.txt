Chet Atkins in Hollywood is the ninth studio album recorded by American guitarist Chet Atkins, released in 1959. The title takes its name from the fact that Atkins recorded it in Hollywood. The lush string arrangements are by Dennis Farnon. Atkins later (in 1961) re-recorded this album in his home studio, using the orchestra tapes from the Hollywood session. The original LP lists Atkins as the producer, the 1961 reissue lists "... with Dennis Farnon and his orchestra" and also lists Dick Peirce as producer.
