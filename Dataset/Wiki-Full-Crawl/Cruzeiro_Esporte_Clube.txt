Cruzeiro Esporte Clube (Brazilian Portuguese: [kuzeju espoti klubi]), commonly known as Cruzeiro and nicknamed Raposa (English: Fox), is a Brazilian multisport club based in Barro Preto, Belo Horizonte. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Mineiro, the state of Minas Gerais's premier state league, as well as in the Campeonato Brasileiro Srie A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system. Cruzeiro is one of the four Brazilian clubs to have never been relegated, along with So Paulo, Flamengo and Santos.
The club was founded on January 2, 1921 by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte, some members of Yale Atltico Clube and many Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called Societ Sportiva Palestra Italia. As a result of the Second World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols referring to the Axis powers in 1942. The club board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the Cruzeiro do Sul's constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the Mineiro stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro's regular kit colours are blue shirts and white shorts with blue socks (although the team has worn white socks with their home kit for certain periods of time). Umbro are the side's current kit manufacturers.
Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its relatively young age (compared with other major Brazilian clubs). It won the Campeonato Brasileiro Srie A for the first time in 1966, after defeating Santos' Os Santsticos in the final series. Cruzeiro has won the Brasileiro again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best campaign in the present format of the competition.
