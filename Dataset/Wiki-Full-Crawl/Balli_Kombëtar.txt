The Balli Kombtar (literally National Front), known as Balli, was an Albanian nationalist anti-communist resistance movement and a political organization established in November 1942. It was led by Ali Klcyra and Midhat Frashri and was formed by members from the landowning elite, liberal nationalists opposed to communism and other sectors of society in Albania. The motto of the Balli Kombtar was: "Shqipria Shqiptarve, Vdekje Tradhtarve" (Albania for the Albanians, Death to the Traitors). Eventually the Balli Kombtar joined the Nazi established puppet government and fought as an ally against anti-fascist guerrilla groups.
