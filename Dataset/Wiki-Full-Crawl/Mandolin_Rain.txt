"Mandolin Rain" is the third track from The Way It Is, the debut album for Bruce Hornsby and the Range. The song, released in late 1986, was a #4 hit single for the band in March 1987, following on the success of their previous single, the #1 hit and title track of their debut album, "The Way It Is". It also reached #1 on the adult contemporary chart for three weeks, and #2 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for two weeks, also in early 1987. The song reached the Top 40 on the Country chart, hitting number 38.
The song was co-written by Bruce Hornsby and his brother John and featured Range member David Mansfield on the title instrument.
It appears to be partly inspired by the song "You Don't Miss Your Water" by William Bell due to it employing the same hook (heard at the beginning of both songs), and by a remarkably similar swing feel (albeit with different chords).
