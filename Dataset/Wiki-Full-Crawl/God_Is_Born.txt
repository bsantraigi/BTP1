"Bg si rodzi" (English: "God Is Born", Polish pronunciation: [buk  rdi]) is a Polish Christmas carol (Polish: kolda), with lyrics written by Franciszek Karpiski in 1792. Its stately melody (the composer has not been established) is traditionally known to be a coronation polonaise for Polish Kings dating back as far as during the reign of Stefan Batory in the 16th century. The carol is regarded by some as the National Christmas hymn of Poland, and, for a short time, it was also considered a national anthem, for instance by poet Jan Lecho. It has also been called "One of the most beloved Polish Christmas carols".The carol was published for the first time in a compilation of Karpiskis works entitled Pieni nabone (Songs of Piety) in 1792. The book was printed by the Basilian monks printing shop in Supral. However, the hymn had been publicly presented already a few years earlier, in the Old Basilica in Biaystok, as Karpiski lived in Biaystoks Branicki Palace in the years from 1785 to 1818. First presentation of the carol is now commemorated by a tablet, located on the wall of the church. The tablet reads: In this church, for the first time ever, Songs of Piety by Franciszek Karpiski were performed. The original title of the carol is Pie o Narodzeniu Paskim (On Gods Nativity or Song of the birth of our Lord).
