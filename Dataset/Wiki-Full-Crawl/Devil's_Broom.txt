"Devil's Broom" is the third single from Joseph Arthur's fourth studio album Our Shadows Will Remain. The single was released on February 13, 2006 in the UK to coincide with his live dates at Shepherd's Bush Empire. It was released on CD and 7" as well as digital download bundles. The CD single's B-side, "Papa," is Joseph's touching ode to his father. He played the song live as early as 1998.
In a positive review, AngryApe.com said of the song: "'Devil's Broom' represents another stroke of understated genius from the musical pallet of Arthur. Mundane and emotive Morrissey styled lyricism and projected singing with a speckle of the troubled cry of Jeff Buckley, is propped up by a wandering accompaniment that Echo & the Bunnymen used to such startling effect."A video for the song was produced, directed by Noaz Deshe. It features Joseph being dragged through a city interspersed with footage of a female lover he longs to be near.
