Sony Corporation of America (SCA), based in New York City, is a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. It is the U.S. headquarters of Sony, under which all Sony companies operate in the United States. 
Sony's principal U.S. businesses include Sony Electronics, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, and Sony/ATV Music Publishing.
It was reported in December of 2016 by multiple news outlets that Sony was considering restructuring its U.S. operations by merging its TV & film business, Sony Pictures Entertainment, with its gaming business, Sony Interactive Entertainment. According to the reports, such a restructuring would have placed Sony Pictures under Sony Interactive's CEO, Andrew House, though House wouldn't have taken over day-to-day operations of the film studio. According to one report, Sony was set to make a final decision on the possibility of the merger of the TV, film, & gaming businesses by the end of its fiscal year in March of the following year (2017). However, judging by Sony's activity in 2017, the rumored merger never materialized.
