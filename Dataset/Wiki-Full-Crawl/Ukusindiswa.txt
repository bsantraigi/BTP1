Ukusindiswa was the seventh release by the South African isicathamiya group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The album was, essentially, a collection of Zulu Christian hymns, whereas previous Mambazo albums had been entirely composed by the group's leader Joseph Shabalala. The album reportedly received gold disc certification within three weeks of its release.
