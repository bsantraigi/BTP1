"Must Have Done Something Right" is the lead single from Relient K's fifth album, Five Score and Seven Years Ago. The song was officially released to radio in January 2007, along with the music video, which was shot in December 2006 and released on February 6, 2007. The song was released to iTunes on November 28. The single comes with a bonus song, "(Hope for Every) Fallen Man". "Must Have Done Something Right" can now be heard at their MySpace page, or at their PureVolume page. The single peaked at No. 45 on the top 40 charts. The song is downloadable for Rock Band 3.
The song's length is 3:07 on the single, but 3:19 in the video and on the album. This is because the song's ending is extended for the album and the video so that it goes another chorus and into a fade out at the end, as opposed to the abrupt ending for the single.
