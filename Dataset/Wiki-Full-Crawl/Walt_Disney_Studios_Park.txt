Walt Disney Studios Park (French: Parc Walt Disney Studios) is the second of two theme parks built at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Valle, France, which opened on March 16, 2002. It is dedicated to show business, themed after movies, production, and behind-the-scenes. In 2016, the park hosted approximately 4.97 million guests, making it the third-most visited amusement park in Europe and the 22nd-most visited in the world, though it has the lowest attendance figures of all twelve Walt Disney parks. Its sister park is Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Florida.
The park is represented by the Earffel Tower, a water tower similar to one that was installed at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California.
On February 27 2018, Bob Iger announced a Transformative Multi Year Expansion, opening in phases from 2021 to 2025, which will completely transform the park. The cost of this expansion is 2 billion euro. It will feature new Marvel, Star Wars and Frozen themed areas, all surrounding a new man-made lake.
