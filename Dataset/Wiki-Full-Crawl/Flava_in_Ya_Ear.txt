"Flava in Ya Ear" is a single by American rapper Craig Mack. The original club mix single was released on 12" vinyl in July 1994 on the Bad Boy Entertainment record label, packaged with a series of additional remixes. According to the song's producer Easy Mo Bee, the track was originally intended for Apache, who was unable to record the song due to being on tour with the group Naughty by Nature at the time, and was not sure of future recordings at the time. As a result, Mo Bee gave the instrumental to Craig Mack after Bad Boy Records' founder Sean Combs gave him a substantial amount of money for the instrumental.The remix of the song features performances by The Notorious B.I.G., LL Cool J, Rampage and Busta Rhymes. It also contains Puff Daddy as a promoter and brief appearances by Keisha Spivey. The video features guest appearances by Das EFX, Mic Geronimo, Irv Gotti and Funkmaster Flex, although none perform on the song. The music video was directed by Craig Henry. The song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995, losing to "U.N.I.T.Y." by Queen Latifah.
The song appeared on Bad Boy's 10th Anniversary... The Hits album. The single itself peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA and sold 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The remix version of the song appears in the video game Dance Central for the Xbox 360.
