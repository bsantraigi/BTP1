"Vision of You" is the fifth single from Belinda Carlisle's Runaway Horses album, released in 1990.
The single was a remixed from the album version, giving it a more uptempo sound. The song was the lowest charting single from the album. In the UK, it only managed to reach #41 but was a hugely popular radio hit, it was remixed and re-released on 12" only a year later after the success of "(We Want) the Same Thing" and "Summer Rain", but it charted lower at #71.
