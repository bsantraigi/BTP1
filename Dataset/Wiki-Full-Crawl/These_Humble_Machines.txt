These Humble Machines is a compilation album by American electronic musician BT, composed of edited versions of songs from his album These Hopeful Machines. Released on April 26, 2011, the album was released with the intention of making the album more accessible for newer listeners while still displaying the same technical prowess found in its predecessor. The album features some radio edits ("Suddenly", "Always") while also liberally using splice editing and fade-outs to edit down songs ("The Emergency", "Every Other Way", "Le nocturne de lumire").
