Empery (foaled 1973 in Kentucky) was an American-bred, French-trained racehorse best known for winning the 1976 Epsom Derby. In a racing career which lasted from September 1975 until July 1976 he ran eight times and won two races. Empery showed some good form in France to be placed third in the Prix Lupin but appeared to be some way below the best colts in his own country. He comfortably defeated the best of the British colts in the Derby to give his jockey Lester Piggott a seventh win in the race. Empery finished second in his only subsequent start and was retired to a stud career of limited success.
