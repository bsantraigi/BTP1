Moselle Franconian (German Moselfrnkisch) is a group of West Central German dialects, part of the Central Franconian language area. 

They are spoken in the southern Rhineland and along the course of the Moselle, in the Siegerland in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, throughout western Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, in the south of the German-speaking Community of Belgium and in the neighbouring French dpartement of Moselle (in Arrondissement of Boulay-Moselle). The Transylvanian Saxon dialect is spoken in the Transylvania region of Romania, as a result of the emigration of numerous "Transylvanian Saxons" between 1100 and 1300, primarily from areas in which the Moselle Franconian dialect was spoken at that time.
