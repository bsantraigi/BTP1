Colonel Richard Geoffrey Pine-Coffin DSO & Bar, MC (2 December 1908  28 February 1974) was an officer of the British Army who saw service during World War II. He commanded the 3rd Parachute Battalion in North Africa and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion in Normandy, Belgium, and Germany. His troops, amused by the unusual applicability of his family name (soldiers were usually buried in simple pine wood coffins), referred to him as "Wooden Box".
