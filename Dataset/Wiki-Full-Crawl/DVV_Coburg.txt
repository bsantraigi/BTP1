The DVV Coburg (full name: Deutsche Jugend Kraft Viktoria Verein fr Bewegungsspiele Coburg e.V.) was a German association football club from the town of Coburg, Bavaria. Coburg became part of Bavaria in 1920, after the First World War.
The club was formed in 2000, when VfB Coburg merged with local side DJK/Viktoria Coburg. Of the three clubs, VfB was by far the most notable, spending 21 seasons in the tier three Fuball-Bayernliga from 1952 to 1984. The club also made a single appearance in the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 197778, losing 30 at fellow amateurs TuS Langerwehe.
DVV was disbanded on 30 June 2012, having declared insolvency in June 2011 owing Euro 118,000 to the German tax department. The club was succeeded by FC Coburg, which took over the league place of DVV.
