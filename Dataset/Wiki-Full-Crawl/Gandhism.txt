Gandhism is a body of ideas that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Mohandas Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance. The two pillars of Gandhism are truth and non-violence.
The term "Gandhism" also encompasses what Gandhi's ideas, words and actions mean to people around the world, and how they used them for guidance in building their own future. Gandhism also permeates into the realm of the individual human being, non-political and non-social. A Gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism.However, Gandhi did not approve of 'Gandhism'.  As he explained:

"There is no such thing as "Gandhism" and I do not want to leave any sect after me. I do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine. I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal truths to our daily life and problems...The opinions I have formed and the conclusions I have arrived at are not final. I may change them tomorrow. I have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and non-violence are as old as the hills."
In the absence of a "Gandhism" approved by Gandhi, there is a school of thought that we have to derive what Gandhism stands for, from his life and works and living.  One such deduction is that his philosophy essentially was based on "truth" and "non-violence" in the sense that first, we should acknowledge the truth that people are different at all levels and accept it.  Second, that we should never resort to violence to settle inherent differences between human beings at all levels: from between two people to two nations or two races or two religions.
