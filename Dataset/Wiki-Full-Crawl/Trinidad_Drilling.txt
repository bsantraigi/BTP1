Trinidad Drilling Ltd. is a corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that operates in the drilling and well servicing sectors of the North American oil and gas industry. The company  converted to an income trust in 2002 and did business under the name Trinidad Energy Services Income Trust. It has since reverted to a corporation under the name Trinidad Drilling.
A strategic review process that began in late 2017, a procedure to court potential buyers looking for a "white knight" to reportedly maximize value for shareholders, was not fruitful. In August 2018 the company was tendered a formal unsolicited offer, that is considered a hostile takeover bid, by Ensign Energy Services. By October 2018 Precision Drilling made an offer, valued at over $1 billion, potentially pitting the two largest Canadian drilling companies against each other.
