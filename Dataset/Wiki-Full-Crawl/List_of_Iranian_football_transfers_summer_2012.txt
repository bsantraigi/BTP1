This is a list of Iranian football transfers for the 2012 summer transfer window. Only moves featuring at least one Iran Pro League or Azadegan League club are listed.
Players without a club may join one at any time, either during or in between transfer windows. Clubs can also sign players on loan at any point during the season. If need be, clubs may sign a goalkeeper on an emergency loan, if all others are unavailable.
