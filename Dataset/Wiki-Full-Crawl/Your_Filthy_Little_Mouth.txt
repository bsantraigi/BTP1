Your Filthy Little Mouth is the fourth full-length studio LP by David Lee Roth, the lead singer of the American rock band Van Halen. Released in 1994 by Warner Brothers-Reprise and produced by Nile Rodgers (producer of albums by David Bowie, Madonna, et cetera), Your Filthy Little Mouth explores relatively disparate genres of popular music, but contextualizes them via rock and blues. The album reflects Roth's growing fascinations with literature and philosophy, as well as his experiences living in New York City's Lower East Side during the early 1990s. The album's artwork, based conceptually on tattoo art and graffiti art, is executed by Roth."She's My Machine" became a rock radio hit in the spring of 1994, reaching #12 on Billboard's Rock Charts. The B-Side to "She's My Machine," an atmospheric blues number titled "Mississippi Power," is available on the Japanese edition of Your Filthy Little Mouth.
