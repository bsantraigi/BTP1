"Winter Melody" is a song by American singer and songwriter Donna Summer released as a single in early-1977 from her Four Seasons of Love album. It became a top 30 hit in the UK, where it peaked at #27.By this time Summer was making her name as the queen of disco music, though this song is a soul ballad. The song represented the "winter" phase of the concept album, and speaks of a woman struggling to come to terms with the fact that her relationship has ended. As with much of Summer's material at that time (particularly with songs found on her concept albums), the song played for a considerable amount of time (over six minutes), however, the song was edited for its release as a single.
