Nathaniel Woodard (21 March 1811  25 April 1891) was a priest in the Church of England.  He founded 11 schools for the middle classes in England whose aim was to provide education based on "sound principle and sound knowledge, firmly grounded in the Christian faith". His educational principles are promoted today through the Woodard Corporation, a registered charity.
