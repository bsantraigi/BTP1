McDonald's Restaurants of Canada, Limited (French: Les Restaurants McDonald du Canada Lte) is the Canadian master franchise of the fast-food restaurant chain McDonald's, owned by the American parent McDonald's Corporation. One of Canada's largest fast-food restaurant chains, the franchise sells food items, including hamburgers, chicken, French fries and soft drinks all across the country. McDonald's is known for its high fat and calorie foods, but it also has alternatives such as salads, juices and milk. McDonald's was previously Canada's largest food service operator before being overtaken by Tim Hortons in 2005. The slogans used in Canada are "i'm lovin' it" (in English) and "c'est a que j'm" (in French).
McDonald's Canadian operations are based in Don Mills in North York, Toronto. The current McDonald's Canada President is John Betts.
