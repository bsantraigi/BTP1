The Community of Madrid (English: ; Spanish: Comunidad de Madrid [komunia e mai]) is one of the seventeen autonomous communities of Spain. It is located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, and of the Castilian Central Plateau (Meseta Central). Its capital is the city of Madrid, which is also the capital of the country. The Community of Madrid is bounded to the south and east by CastillaLa Mancha and to the north and west by Castile and Len. It was formally created in 1983, based on the limits of the province of Madrid, which was until then conventionally included in the historical region of New Castile.
The Community of Madrid is the third most populous in Spain with 6,549,979 (2018) inhabitants mostly concentrated in the metropolitan area of Madrid. It is also the most densely populated autonomous community. Madrid's economy is roughly equal in size to that of Catalonia, which remains Spain's largest. Madrid thus has the highest GDP per capita in the country.
