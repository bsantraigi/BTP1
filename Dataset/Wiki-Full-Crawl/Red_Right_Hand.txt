"Red Right Hand" is a 1994 song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. It first appeared on the album Let Love In, where it ran at over six minutes. A condensed version was later released as a single.
A dark, ominous alternative rock track, it has become one of Cave's signature songs, being performed at most of his concerts; only "The Mercy Seat" has appeared in more of his live sets since 1984. It has been covered by Arctic Monkeys, PJ Harvey, Iggy Pop and Jarvis Cocker, among others.
The title comes from John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, in which it refers to the vengeful hand of God.
