Oryzomyini, or rice rat, is a tribe of rodents in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae. It includes about 120 species in about thirty genera, distributed from the eastern United States to the southernmost parts of South America, including many offshore islands. It is part of the clade Oryzomyalia, which includes most of the South American Sigmodontinae.
The name Oryzomyini derives from that of its type genus, Oryzomys, which means "rice rat" or "rice mouse". Many species are also known as rice rats.
