Interstate 35 (I-35) is a northsouth Interstate Highway in the United States that stretches from Laredo, Texas, to Duluth, Minnesota. In Minnesota, the route travels from south to north and terminates after slightly deflecting to the east near the state line with Wisconsin. The highway enters the state near Albert Lea from Iowa and intersects I-90 shortly after. Passing through Owatonna, I-35 continues north nearing the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. It enters them in the south, bridging across Lake Marion and passing by Crystal Lake, where it splits into Interstates 35E and 35W, going through Saint Paul and Minneapolis respectively. Northeastern of the twin cities, I-35E and I-35W join again, and I-35 continues to the northeast, where it crosses the St. Louis River south of Scanlon and terminates in Duluth at its junction with Minnesota Highway 61 (MN 61).
Interstates 35 and 35E closely parallel U.S. Highway 61 from the city of Saint Paul to the city of Wyoming.
Interstate 35 parallels Chisago County Road 61, State Highway 361, Pine County Road 61, and Carlton County Road 61.
State Highway 23 runs concurrent with Interstate 35 between Hinckley and Sandstone.
