Hypsiboas is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. Their common name is either gladiator frogs or Wagler Neotropical treefrogs. These frogs are distributed in the tropical Central and South America from Nicaragua to Argentina, as well as in the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago).This genus was resurrected in 2005 following a major revision of Hylidae. Some 70 species previously placed in the genus Hyla were moved to this genus. Since then, many news species have also been described.
