Lucilio Vanini (1585  9 February 1619), who, in his works, styled himself Giulio Cesare Vanini, was an Italian philosopher, physician and free-thinker, who was one of the first significant representatives of intellectual libertinism. He was among the first modern thinkers who viewed the universe as an entity governed by natural laws (nomological determinism). He was also the first literate proponent of biological evolution, maintaining that humans and other apes have common ancestor.
