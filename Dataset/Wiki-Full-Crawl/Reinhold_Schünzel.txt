Reinhold Schnzel (7 November 1888  11 November 1954) was a German actor and director, active in both Germany and the United States. The son of a German father and a Jewish mother, he was born in St. Pauli, the poorest part of Hamburg. Despite being Jewish, Schnzel was allowed by the Nazis to continue making films for several years until he eventually left to live abroad.
