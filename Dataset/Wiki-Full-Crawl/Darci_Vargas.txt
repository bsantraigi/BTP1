Darci Lima Sarmanho Vargas (12 December 1895  25 June 1968) was the wife of Getlio Vargas, former President of Brazil, and the First Lady of the country during two different periods (from 1930 to 1945 and from 1951 until her husband's suicide).
Darci and Getlio Vargas, whom she married in March 1911, had five children. However, the president was an unfaithful husband. Aime de Heeren, later the daughter-in-law of Fernanda Wanamaker, was reported to be one of his mistresses. 
She became a notable philanthropist and founded many charitable organizations.
