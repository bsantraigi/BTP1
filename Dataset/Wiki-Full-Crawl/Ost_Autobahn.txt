The (Austrian) Ost Autobahn A4 or "Eastern Motorway" is part of the European route E60 and goes from Vienna to the town of Nickelsdorf, on the Hungarian border.
The road begins at the A23 at the Prater junction in Vienna, travels through Simmering, Schwechat, Vienna International Airport, Fischamend, Bruck an der Leitha, Parndorf, Weiden am See and Mnchhof to the border town of Nickelsdorf. Crossing the border into Hegyeshalom, the road becomes the Hungarian M1 motorway which then continues on to Budapest. The road is 66 km long.
During the overflow of asylum seekers traveling from Hungary during September 2015, the highway was closed intermittently preventing the traffic between Hungary and Austria, and it was reported that Austrian army was deployed on the border.
