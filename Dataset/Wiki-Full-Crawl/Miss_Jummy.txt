Miss Jummy (18831889), was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare who won two British Classic Races in 1886. In a career that lasted from July 1885 to September 1886 the filly ran fifteen times and won eight races at distances ranging from five furlongs to one and three quarter miles. As a two-year-old in 1885, Miss Jummy won three times from seven starts, but when tried in the highest class she was unplaced behind the future Triple Crown winner Ormonde in the Dewhurst Stakes. In 1886, Miss Jummy was unbeaten when racing against her own age and sex, winning five races including the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom, the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster. She was unsuccessful in open competition, finishing unplaced in the Grand Prix de Paris and the Eclipse Stakes. At the end of 1886 she was retired to stud where her record was disappointing.
