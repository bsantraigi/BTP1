Williams (Havasupai: Wii Gvul) is a city in Coconino County, Arizona, west of Flagstaff. Its population was 3,158 in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . It lies on the route of Historic Route 66, Interstate 40, and the Southwest Chief Amtrak train route. It is also the southern terminus of the Grand Canyon Railway, which takes visitors to Grand Canyon Village.  There are numerous inns, motels, restaurants and gas stations that cater to the large influx of tourists rather than local residents, especially during the summer and holiday seasons.
Also known as the "Gateway to the Grand Canyon", Williams was the last town on
Historic Route 66 to be bypassed by Interstate 40. The community, bypassed on October
13, 1984, continues to thrive on tourism.
Boasting seven area fishing lakes, hiking trails up Bill Williams Mountain and into
Sycamore Canyon, an alpine ski area and cross country ski trails, four seasons weather
and an abundance of wildlife, Williams offers unlimited recreational opportunities for the
outdoor enthusiast.
The Historic Downtown District covers six square blocks. The town boasts a rich heritage that features the Old West and Route 66, coupled with tourism trends today and the town's heyday years of the '50s and '60s.
