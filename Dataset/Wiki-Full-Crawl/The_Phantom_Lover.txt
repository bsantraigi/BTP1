The Phantom Lover (Chinese: ) is a 1995 Hong Kong film starring Leslie Cheung and Jacqueline Wu. It was directed by Ronny Yu and is a remake of the 1937 film Song at Midnight. The film itself is a loose adaptation of the classic Romeo and Juliet romance where love between two passionate lovers were ultimately doomed when parental opposition was the major obstacle. The main theme of the film was, however, a strong adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. The film's language is entirely in Mandarin.
