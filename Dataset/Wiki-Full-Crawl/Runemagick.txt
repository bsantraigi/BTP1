Runemagick is a Swedish death/doom band formed in 1990. The band was started by Nicklas "Terror" Rudolfsson under the name Desiderius, which was quickly changed to Runemagic. First, the band consisted solely of Rudolfsson, but he was later joined by Robert "Reaper" Pehrsson. They started out as a pure death metal band but later incorporated doom metal influences, inspired by the likes of Bathory, Treblinka/Tiamat, Celtic Frost, Nihilist/Entombed, and Candlemass.After a few demos the band fell apart in 1993. Rudolfsson restored Runemagic in 1997 with Fredrik Johnsson on guitar and Peter Palmdahl on bass; he also added the "k" to the name (see also magick). A rehearsal demo with Nicklas on drums was recorded and sent to Century Media Records, which got them a record deal for three albums. After many line-up changes, in 2000, the band parted with Century Media and eventually landed on the Norwegian label Aftermath Music.After the album "Dawn of the End" 2007 the band fell into a long sleep but resumed in 2017. In 2018 the band recorded and released a new album "Evoked From Abysmal Sleep" released by Aftermath Music, Parasitic Records and Flowing Downwards. The band also played live first the first time since 2005 at Kill-Town Deathfest in Copenhagen, Denmark.
