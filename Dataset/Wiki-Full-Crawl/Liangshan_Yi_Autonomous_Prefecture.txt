Liangshan (Chinese: ; Yi:  Niep Sha, pronounced [n]), officially the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, is an autonomous prefecture occupying much of the southern extremity of Sichuan province, People's Republic of China; its seat is Xichang. Liangshan has an area of 60,423 km2 (23,329 sq mi) and over 4.5 million inhabitants (2010). It is also has the largest population of ethnic Yi nationally. Liangshan Li contains a number of isolated villages high up on its cliffs, often known as "cliff villages".Yi people came into Chinese and western history books as "" (Lolo) and "" (Yi) in the beginning. After the Chinese Communist Party came into power in mainland China, the government changed the spelling of the name from "" to "" since the old character was derogatory.
The appellations of Lolo, Lolopu, etc. are related to the Yi peoples worship of the tiger, as lo in their dialects means "tiger". Lo is also the basis for the Chinese exonym Lulu , , or . The original character, , with the "dog radical" and a gu  phonetic, was considered condescending, comparable to the Chinese name guran  "a long-tailed ape".
Writing reform in the Peoples Republic of China replaced the  character in Lulu twice: first by Lu , with the "human radical" and the same phonetic, but that was a graphic variant for lu  "naked"; and later by Lu  "net for catching birds". However, the stigma remained and resulted in negative remarks when people of the prefecture visited other cities, so the government changed the name of the prefecture.
Xichang has the Xichang Qingshan Airport and the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The prefecture also features a substantial network of railways for both passengers and freight.
