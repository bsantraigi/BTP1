Pentatomidae are a family of insects belonging to the order Hemiptera, which are generally called stink bugs or shield bugs (members of the sister family Acanthosomatidae are also called "shield bugs"). The name Pentatomidae is from the Greek pente meaning five and tomos meaning  section, which refers to the five segments of their antennae.
