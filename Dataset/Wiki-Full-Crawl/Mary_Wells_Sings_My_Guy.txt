Mary Wells Sings My Guy is the fourth studio album and fifth overall album released by Motown vocalist Mary Wells. The album features her signature hit of the same name (which had already appeared on Greatest Hits earlier in the year) and the proposed singles "Whisper You Love Me Boy" and "He's the One I Love", the latter later re-recorded by Tammi Terrell during her own brief Motown tenure. It turned out to be the last studio effort Wells released for Motown as she left the label that year for 20th Century Fox Records.
Dezo Hoffmann was credited for front cover photography, with Lee Ivory writing the sleeve notes.
