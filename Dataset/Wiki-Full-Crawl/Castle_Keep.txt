Castle Keep is a 1969 American Technicolor war film combining surrealism with tragic realism filmed in Panavision.  It was directed by Sydney Pollack and starred Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Bruce Dern, and Peter Falk. The movie appeared in the summer of 1969, a few months before the arrival of Pollack's smash hit They Shoot Horses, Don't They?.
The film is based on a novel by William Eastlake published in 1965. Eastlake enlisted in the US Army in 1942. He served in the Infantry for four and a half years, and was wounded while leading a platoon during the Battle of the Bulge.
The film was also tied to the real life events which inspired The Amityville Horror as it was the film Ronald DeFeo Jr. was watching when he decided to murder his family
