Curvularia is a hyphomycete (mold) fungus which is a facultative pathogen of many plant species and common in soil. Most Curvularia are found in tropical regions, though a few are found in temperate zones.
Curvularia defined by the type species C. lunata (Wakker) Boedijn. Curvularia lunata  appears  as  shiny  velvety-black,  fluffy growth on the colony surface. C. lunata is distinguished by septate, dematiaceous hyphae producing brown, geniculate conidiophores. The poroconidia are curved slightly to distinctly, transversely septate, with an expanded third cell from the pore end of the conidium. Curvularia can  be  easily  distinguished  from  Bipolaris  and  Drechslera  spp. since the conidia are non-distoseptate, that is, septate from edge to edge of the conidial wall. The teleomorphic state of the type species Curvularia lunata is Cochliobolus lunatus (Fam. Pleosporaceae, Ord. Pleosporales, Cla. Loculoascomycetes, Phy. Ascomycota).
