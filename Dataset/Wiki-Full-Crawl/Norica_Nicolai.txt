Norica Nicolai (born Norica Clinci; January 27, 1958) is a Romanian lawyer and politician. An independent who previously belonged to the National Liberal Party (PNL) and before that the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (PN-CD), she was a member of the Romanian Senate for Cluj County from 2000 to 2008, and has been a Member of the European Parliament since 2009. She was at the centre of a conflict between Prime Minister Clin Popescu-Triceanu and President Traian Bsescu in early 2008, with the latter rejecting, ultimately successfully, the former's nomination of Nicolai to be Justice Minister.
She is married and has one child.
