The Kavli Prize was established in 2005 through a joint venture between the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, and The Kavli Foundation. The main objective for the Prize is to honor, support and recognize scientists for outstanding scientific work in the fields of astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience and award three international prizes every second year. The Kavli Prize was awarded the first time in Oslo, 9 September 2008.  The Prizes were presented by Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway.  Each of the three Kavli Prizes consists of a gold medal, a scroll, and a cash award of US $1,000,000.
