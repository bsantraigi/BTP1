That Lady in Ermine is a 1948 American Technicolor musical film directed by Ernst Lubitsch. The screenplay by Samson Raphaelson is based on the operetta Die Frau im Hermelin by Rudolph Schanzer and Ernst Welisch.
Although Lubitsch received sole credit as director, he died after only eight days of filming, and the project was completed by Otto Preminger.
