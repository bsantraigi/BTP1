"The Last Time" is the first single from Agnetha Fltskog's third English solo-album I Stand Alone, released in 1987. "The Last Time" was released as both 7 and 12 inch singles, as well as a 3-inch CD. The latter two also featured an extended version of the song.
The song contained a different sound from Fltskog's previous work due to the West Coast American influences of the producers, Peter Cetera and Bruce Gaitsch. Despite a modern sound and a well-known producer, the single was not a resounding success. Fltskog did promote the song, including visiting London in February 1988, but the single only reached No.77 in the UK. In The Netherlands, where Fltskog traditionally had a large fan base, the single peaked at No. 18.
For the South American market, Fltskog recorded a Spanish version of "The Last Time" called "La ltima Vez".  This version also appeared on the South American version of the album and is considered to be a rare recording.
In 1993 Mark Free covered this song and it is on his album Long Way From Love.
