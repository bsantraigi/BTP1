Broadway-Blues-Ballads is an album by singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone. It was her second album for Philips. In contrast to her first Philips album, the live In Concert, which was politically laden with civil rights motifs, this studio album is more playful. It is not regarded as one of Simone's best efforts, though it contains songs that became standards in her repertoire.
