Sami Frashri (Turkish: emseddin Sami Bey; June 1, 1850  June 18, 1904) was an Ottoman Albanian writer, philosopher, playwright and a prominent figure of the Rilindja Kombtare, the National Renaissance movement of Albania, together with his two brothers Abdyl and Naim. He also supported Turkish nationalism against its Ottoman counterpart as well as laicism against theocracy.Frashri was one of the sons of an impoverished Bey from Frashr (Fraer during the Ottoman rule) in the District of Prmet. He gained a place in Ottoman literature as a talented author under the name of emseddin Sami Efendi and contributed to the Ottoman Turkish language reforms.
Frashri's message, however as declared in his book "Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Rilindja Kombtare. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their own alphabet and education, Frashri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country.
