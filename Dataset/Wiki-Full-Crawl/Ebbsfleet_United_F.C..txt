Ebbsfleet United Football Club is an English football club based in Northfleet, Kent, that competes in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. The team's home ground has been Stonebridge Road since its inception in 1946.
Before 2007, the club was called Gravesend & Northfleet.  Between 2008 and 2013, the club was owned by the web-based venture MyFootballClub, whose members voted on player transfers, budgets and ticket prices among other things instead of those decisions being made exclusively by the club's management and staff as at most other clubs.
