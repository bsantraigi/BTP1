"Truly Yours" is a 1966 song and single by The Spinners for the Motown label. Co-written and produced by William "Mickey" Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter, the single became the Detroit-reared group's second to chart on the company label, and the fourth to chart altogether. It was also the last to chart in the 1960s and last to chart for the group until "It's a Shame". The single peaked at 11 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. However, on the Billboard R&B singles chart, "Truly Yours" was a Top 20 hit, peaking at number 16.During this period, as Motown treated the group as a second-tier signing, the label released one single a year from 1964 to 1969 only. Thus commercial success would elude the group until 1970.
The song was later covered in 1967 by the Temptations and Hunter himself. The Temptations version would unreleased until 1986, while Hunter version, backed by The Temptations, would be released on January 12, 2005.
