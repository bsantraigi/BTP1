The Mating Call is a 1928 pre-Code silent drama film about a soldier who returns home from World War I to find his marriage has been annulled and his wife has remarried. The film was produced by Howard Hughes for his Caddo Corporation, and was originally released by Paramount Pictures. It is based on a novel, The Mating Call, by Rex Beach. In 2006, the film was restored and re-released by Turner Classic Movies in partnership with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, along with two other Hughes-produced films Two Arabian Knights (1927) and The Racket (1928). Rene Adore had a brief nude scene in the film.
