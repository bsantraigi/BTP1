"Say What You Want" is a song by Scottish group Texas and the first single to be taken from their fourth studio album White on Blonde. It was remixed as "Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)" featuring Method Man and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan and re-released as a double A-side with "Insane" in 1998. Both versions featured on their 2000 album The Greatest Hits.
It is the band's biggest hit commercially to date, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart, with the remixed version reaching number four. Two music videos were made to promote the single, the first video (which is the most common and has the original version) shows lead singer Sharleen Spiteri in a futuristic room and the second video has the remixed version and shows Spiteri in a park. As of February 2015 the single has sold 451,000 copies in United Kingdom. The song includes interpolations of "Sexual Healing" by Marvin Gaye and "Love... Thy Will Be Done" by Martika.
