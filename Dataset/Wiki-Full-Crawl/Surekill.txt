"Surekill" is the eighth episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on January 7, 2001. The episode was written by Greg Walker and directed by Terrence O'Hara. "Surekill" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.0 and was viewed by 13.3 million viewers. Overall, the episode received largely negative reviews from critics.
The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)following the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling to find out who committed the murder and how the crime was committed. Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is more to this case than meets the eye.
Due to the presence of his "biker buddy" Michael Bowen, series co-star Robert Patrick was noticeably more energized than usual to film the episode, according to Gillian Anderson. In addition, scenes at "AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators", the business run by Randall and Dwight, were filmed at an actual business front located on Palmetto Street in Los Angeles.
