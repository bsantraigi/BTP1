Carter Maness of New York blog RCRD LBL wrote "Marching along with loose floor toms, swelling guitar and sweet female harmonies, Aussie rockers Little Scout really succeed at the oft-attempted 'bringing garage rock to the beach' concept. "Go Quietly" is pure summer fun  a bit dreamy, a bit whimsical, a bit soaked."
