The National Trade Union Centre of Trinidad and Tobago (NATUC) is a national trade union center in Trinidad and Tobago. It was created in 1991 by the merger of the Trinidad and Tobago Labour Congress (TTLC) and the Council of Progressive Trade Unions (CPTU). It has a membership of 80,000.
The NATUC is affiliated to the International Trade Union Confederation and the Caribbean Congress of Labour.
Following the 2000 Convention, divisions took place in NATUC which resulted in the formation of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and Non-Governmental Organisations (FITUN) as a separate trade union centre.
