I Love Everybody is the fifth album by Lyle Lovett, released in 1994.  The album consists of songs written by Lovett prior to the recording of his first album, Lyle Lovett (1986).On the 8th track, "Record Lady," Lyle refers to college friend and fellow musician, Robert Earl Keen.

...Robert Earl, he's a friend of mine
You know he's always looking out for my best interest...
Several songs prominently feature one or more of Lovett's trademark penchants: wry humor (They Don't Like Me), playful surrealism (Penguins) and disturbing frankness (Creeps Like Me).
Lovett's wife at the time, Julia Roberts, provides backing vocals on several tracks. Other performers lending their voice include Rickie Lee Jones and Leo Kottke.
