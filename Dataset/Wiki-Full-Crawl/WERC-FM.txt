WERC-FM (105.5 FM)  branded News Radio 105.5 WERC  is a news/talk radio station licensed to Hoover, Alabama and serving the Birmingham market. It operates at an effective radiated power of 29.5 kilowatts. It is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..  The station has studios at Beacon Ridge Tower in Birmingham  and its transmitter is atop Red Mountain.
From 1997 until 2008, the 105.5 FM frequency was home to the WENN call letters, which for many years were synonymous to many listeners from Birmingham and most of Central and North Alabama as a legendary urban station with a wide reaching signal.  The station's current format originated in 1982 at 960 AM, and is the oldest news/talk format in Birmingham; as a result, WERC-FM is an indirect descendent of Birmingham's first radio station, WBRC.  After the talk format and WERC calls migrated to the 105.5 facility, the 960 facility adopted the WVVB call letters and "Vulcan" branding - which were both originally used at the 105.5 frequency between the discontinuation of WENN (of which "The Vulcan" was its last format before the call change to WVVB) and the conversion to WERC-FM. Later that year, however, 960 AM returned to its old news/talk format and switched its call sign back to WERC, though this time branding as a repeater of WERC-FM.
Like most iHeartMedia, Inc. talk stations, WERC-FM airs several local programs, as well as nationally syndicated programs such as The Glenn Beck Program, The Rush Limbaugh Show and The Michael Berry Show. In addition, WERC simulcasts the audio feed of WBRC-TV's early morning and late night newscasts, along with breaking news/weather coverage (in effect continuing the linkage between WERC and its onetime sister TV station). Overnight, the station broadcasts the syndicated Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory. The station also broadcasts the syndicated Saturday night program Somewhere In Time, which consists of reruns of Art Bell-hosted editions of Coast to Coast AM.
