"You're My Star" is a pop rock song by Welsh rock band Stereophonics from their greatest hits album, Decade in the Sun: Best of Stereophonics. It was released as the lead-single on 27 October 2008 with "Forever" as the B-side. It was produced by lead-singer and guitarist Kelly Jones along with Jim Lowe while written by the singer. The song was written in a day and is a personal one to Jones, though he would not say what the song is really about, instead leaving it to listeners to make up their own theory. One critic stated that the song is written about his daughters, but this has not been confirmed to be true. The single went on to become the band's first to miss the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart and received a negative critic review.
