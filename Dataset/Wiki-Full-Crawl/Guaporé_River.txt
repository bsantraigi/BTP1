Guapor River (Portuguese: Rio Guapor, Spanish: Ro Itnez) is a river in western Brazil and northeastern Bolivia. It is 1,530 km (950 mi) long; 970 km (600 mi) of the river forms the border between Brazil and Bolivia.
The Guapor River is part of the Madeira River basin, which eventually empties into the Amazon River. The Guapor River crosses the eastern part of the Beni savanna region.
It forms the border of the 615,771 hectares (1,521,600 acres) Guapor Biological Reserve, and is fed by rivers originating in the reserve, the So Miguel, Branco, So Simo, Massaco and Colorado.About 260 fish species are known from the Guapor River basin, and about 25 of these are endemic. While many fish species in the river essentially are Amazonian, the fauna in the Guapor also has a connection with the Paraguay River (part of the Ro de la Plata Basin). The Guapor and the Paraguay, while flowing in different directions, both originate in the Parecis plateau of Brazil. Among the fish species shared between these rivers are the black phantom tetra (important in the aquarium industry) and golden dorado (important in fisheries).
