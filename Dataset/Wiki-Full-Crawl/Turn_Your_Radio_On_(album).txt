Turn Your Radio On was Ray Stevens' eighth studio album and his third for Barnaby Records, released in 1972. Unlike Stevens' previous album releases, this album shows Stevens' spiritual side and was his first album of gospel. The fourth track, "Let Your Love Be a Light unto the People", was written by Stevens' brother, John Ragsdale. The sixth track, "Have a Little Talk With Myself," was taken from Stevens' album of the same name. The album includes four singles, three of which were issued before this album's release: "A Mama and a Papa," the traditional gospel song "All My Trials," the title track, and "Love Lifted Me", the last of which did not chart.
The album was reissued by CBS Records in 1982.
On November 15, 2005, Collectables Records re-released this album and his 1975 album Misty together on one CD.
