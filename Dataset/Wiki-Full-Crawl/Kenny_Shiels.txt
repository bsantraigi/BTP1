Kenny Shiels (born 27 April 1956 in Magherafelt) is a Northern Irish football player and manager who last managed Derry City in the League of Ireland. He spent all of his playing career at different levels in the Irish Football League.
Shiels then moved into coaching with the Northern Ireland national football team (under 17s) and English league side Tranmere Rovers (head of youth development). He moved to Scottish Premier League club Kilmarnock in 2010 to assist manager Mixu Paatelainen. Shiels was promoted to manager in 2011, after Paatelainen was appointed manager of Finland. Kilmarnock won the Scottish League Cup in his first season in charge, but he was sacked in June 2013 after he had been frequently punished by the Scottish Football Association for making controversial comments. Shiels was appointed manager of Scottish Championship club Greenock Morton in December 2013, and resigned in May 2014. He became Derry City manager in 2015.
