The Bront Sisters (French: Les Surs Bront) is a 1979 French drama film directed by Andr Tchin. It tells the story of the famous Bront siblings.
The film was written by Tchin with the collaboration of Pascal Bonitzer and Jean Gruault. The cinematography was by Bruno Nuytten. It was a project that Tchin  wanted to make since 1972, but only after the favorable reception of Souvenirs d'en France (1975) and Barocco (1976), he was able to find the necessary financing. Produced by Gaumont, the film's originally running time was cut from three to less than two hours upon its release at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.The film stars Isabelle Adjani as Emily, Marie-France Pisier  as Charlotte and Isabelle Huppert as Anne. Pascal Greggory plays their brother Branwell Bront. The plot centers on the sisters' sombre relationship with Branwell.
Set in a careful recreation of the period, the film follows the bleak lives of the four siblings in less than a ten-year span. It begins in 1834, when, at the age of seventeen, Branwell painted the famous portrait of his three sisters, in which he originally included his own image, and ends around 1852 when Charlotte, now a famous author, is the only surviving sibling.
