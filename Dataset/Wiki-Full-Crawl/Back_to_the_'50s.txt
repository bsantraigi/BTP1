Back to the '50s is the first one off sitcom from the British pop group S Club 7. It first aired 1999 and was produced for CITV. In this movie, the cast proceeds with their long drive from Miami to Los Angeles - when they suddenly find themselves in the 1950s, having travelled back in time. The episode itself is a parody of both the films, Grease & Back to the Future.
