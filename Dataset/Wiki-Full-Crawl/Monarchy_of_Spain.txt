The 1st Government under the restored Monarchy of Spain or the Third Arias Navarro Cabinet (13 December 1975-1 July 1976) was the first Council of Ministers created after the death of Francisco Franco. The King Juan Carlos I asked Arias Navarro to make a government for the new era. He proved incapable of adapting to the coming changes and was reluctant to democratize the regime, preferring to preserve the legacy of Franco. Just 7 months after the formation of the government, after a heated meeting with the monarch, he submitted his resignation on 1 July 1976.
