Hulsea is a small genus of North American flowering plants in the sunflower family known commonly as alpinegold.Alpinegolds are annual or perennial herbs native to western North America. They produce stout erect stems which may be fuzzy, hairy, or quite woolly. They are leafy, especially toward the base of the stem. At the top of the stem they bear small daisylike flower heads, with ray florets in shades of yellow to reddish-orange around a center packed with disc florets. The fruits are generally hard and black with a pappus.
