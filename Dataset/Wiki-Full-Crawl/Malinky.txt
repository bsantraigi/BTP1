Pinky Malinky is an upcoming animated web television series created by Chris Garbutt and Rikke Asbjoern for Nickelodeon and Netflix, based on Garbutt's animated short of the same name produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, which was released in 2009. It marks the very first collaboration between Nickelodeon and Netflix. In 2015, the series was greenlit by Nickelodeon for a pickup of 20 episodes. The series was originally set to premiere on Nickelodeon in 2016, but was delayed many times until 2019. It chronicles the adventures of Pinky Malinky (voiced by Lucas Grabeel), a 12-year-old middle school student who also happens to be an anthropomorphic hot dog, and his efforts to climb up the social ladder with his two human friends, Babs Buttman (Diamond White) and JJ Jameson (Nathan Kress).
On June 21, 2018, it was announced that Pinky Malinky would be released exclusively on Netflix, and that the show was renewed for a second season. Weeks later, the company's See What's Next Twitter account announced an August 17 release date, though the series was not released by Netflix on that date, leading to yet another delay of the series.
On September 16, 2018, Chris Garbutt posted on Instagram that there was a slight delay in the release date, and it was Netflix's responsibility to release it. Season 1 has been confirmed to release on Netflix on January 1, 2019.  Lucas Grabeel is also due to perform at the New Year's Countdown as Pinky.
