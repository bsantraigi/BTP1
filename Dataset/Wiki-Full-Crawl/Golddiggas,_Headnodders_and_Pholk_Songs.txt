Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs is the ninth and penultimate album by The Beautiful South, released in 2004.  It is almost entirely a covers album, with one notable exception.  The track "This Old Skin" was originally claimed to have been written by Bobby Christiansand/Barry Klein, and to have been originally performed by an obscure band called "The Heppelbaums" in the 1970s, but it was later revealed to have been an original composition by the usual Beautiful South writing team, Paul Heaton and Dave Rotheray.  This was confirmed in 2006 by frontman Paul Heaton during a Question and Answer session entitled "Ask the Band".  Prior to that, a website for The Heppelbaums had been created, in which many more clues to the real identity of the band were revealed. The domain was created on 5 August 2004 and registered to Sony, the band's record label. Although the website no longer exists, the contents can still be found on Archived 7 May 2006 at the Wayback Machine.
"Livin' Thing", "This Old Skin", and "This Will Be Our Year" were all released as singles.
