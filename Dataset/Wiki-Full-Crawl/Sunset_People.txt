"Sunset People" is a song by American singer Donna Summer taken from her very successful album Bad Girls. The album, released on Casablanca Records in the US, had already produced several chart-topping singles for the disco star, but Summer had resigned from the label and taken a lawsuit against them. She had since signed to Geffen Records and was getting ready to release her first album with them (which had moved away from the disco sound). The single was not released in the North American market because of ongoing litigation.
The song was also used for the unsold 1985 game show pilot called Split Decision hosted by Jim McKrell.
The song was covered by E. G. Daily in 1985 for her debut album Wild Child.
