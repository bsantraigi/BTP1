The Silence of the Hams (Italian: Il Silenzio dei Prosciutti)  is a 1994 Italian-American satirical comedy film written by, directed by, and starring Italian comedian Ezio Greggio. It is a parody of many popular thriller and horror films, notably The Silence of the Lambs and Psycho. Along with Greggio, the film features an ensemble cast of Dom DeLuise, Billy Zane, Joanna Pacua, Charlene Tilton, and Martin Balsam.
The comedy, like many of its contemporaries (including The Naked Gun), is largely driven by word play, sight gags, running jokes, and multiple references to popular culture of the time, such as Michael Jackson's Thriller, and tongue-in-cheek references to the then-current state of American politics (such as a fight scene between Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton). As a curiosity,   Mel Brooks, who made a number of well regarded parodies (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs), appeared in a cameo.
