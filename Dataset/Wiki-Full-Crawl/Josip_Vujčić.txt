The Show Must Go On is a 2010 Croatian science fiction drama directed and written by Nevio Marasovi, starring Sven Medveek and Nataa Dori.
A dystopian story about a TV producer who keeps his reality show's contestants unaware of a global war raging outside their compound, Marasovi's debut feature film debut was shot on a very low budget. It won several awards at the Croatian national film festival in Pula and was welcomed by the critics, despite receiving mixed reviews.
