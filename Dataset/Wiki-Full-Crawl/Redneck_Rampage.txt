Redneck Rampage is a 1997 first-person shooter game developed by Xatrix Entertainment and published by Interplay. The game is a first person shooter with a variety of weapons and levels, but has a hillbilly theme, primarily taking place in a fictional Arkansas town.  Many of the weapons and power-ups border on nonsensical, and in some ways it is a parody of both first shooter games and rural American life.  It features music by psychobilly artists such as The Beat Farmers and Mojo Nixon. The game has been re-released on GOG.com and Steam with support for Windows and macOS.
