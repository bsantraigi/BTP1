The Kashubs (Kashubian: Kaszbi; Polish: Kaszubi; German: Kaschuben; also spelled Kaszubians, Kassubians, Cassubians, Cashubes, and Kashubians, and formerly known as Kashubes) are a Lechitic ethnic group in Pomerelia, north-central Poland. Their settlement area is referred to as Kashubia (Kashubian: Kaszb; Polish: Kaszuby; German: Kaschubei, Kaschubien). They speak the Kashubian language, which is classified either as a separate language closely related to Polish, or as a Polish dialect.  Analogously to their linguistic classification, the Kashubs are considered either an ethnic or a linguistic community.  The Kashubs are closely related to the Poles. The Kashubs are grouped with the Slovincians as Pomeranians. Similarly, the Slovincian (now extinct) and Kashubian languages are grouped as Pomeranian languages, with Slovincian (also known as eba Kashubian) either a distinct language closely related to Kashubian, or a Kashubian dialect.
