A bur (also spelled burr) is a seed or dry fruit or infructescence that has hooks or teeth.
Some other forms of diaspores, such as the stems of certain species of cactus also are covered with thorns and may function as burs.
Bur-bearing plants such as Xanthium species are often single-stemmed when growing in dense groups, but branch and spread when growing singly.
