Better Dayz is the eighth studio album and fourth posthumous album by the late American rapper 2Pac, the third to be released without the artist's creative input and is the last to be a double-album.
It was released on November 26, 2002, debuting at number 5 on the Billboard 200. This album is the second of two albums (the first being Until the End of Time) that consists of a collection of previously unreleased material by way of remixed songs from Tupac's "Makaveli" period while signed to Death Row Records, and was produced by Johnny "J", Jazze Pha, Frank Nitty, and E.D.I. of Outlawz. It includes "Military Minds" which features Boot Camp Clik members Buckshot and Smif-n-Wessun (credited as Cocoa Brovaz) which was supposed to be part of a collaborative album between Shakur and BCC titled One Nation but was never officially released due to Shakur's death. Better Dayz has no censored references to Death Row Records unlike the previous album, Until the End of Time. The only track on the album pre-Death Row era is "My Block (Remix)", which was recorded in 19941995 during Shakur's time with Interscope Records, and which the original version can be found on The Show. The Song Late Night featuring DJ Quik, has been removed from all digital versions of the album for an unknown reason.
It features unreleased recordings from the 19941996 period, the majority of which are remixed Mainly Between Thug Life Volume 1& The Don Killuminati:The 7 Day Theory. Others retain their original form or are complete finished mixes, such as "Fuck 'Em All", "Late Night", "Ghetto Star", "Better Dayz", "Who Do U Believe In?" and "They Don't Give a Fuck About Us". The album features appearances by Outlawz, Ron Isley, Nas, Ma, Jazze Pha and Tyrese, among others. The hit single, "Thugz Mansion," comes in two versions: an acoustic version featuring Nas, on which the music video is based, and a hip hop version featuring Anthony Hamilton.
