Philip Kenneth Barnes (born 2 March 1979) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Handsworth Parramore.
Having started his professional career at Rotherham United in 1996, he first made a name for himself as Blackpool's first choice goalkeeper from 1997 to 2004. He notched up 141 league appearances during his spell with the club which earned him a move to Sheffield United. Despite being primarily used as back-up to Paddy Kenny, Barnes was part of the United squad that earned promotion to the Premier League in 2006. Before this he had also spent time on loan with both Torquay United and Queens Park Rangers. Following the Blades promotion, Barnes signed for Grimsby Town where he remained for two years and was the Supporters Player of the Season for the 200708 season. Following a change in management and a drop in Grimsby's fortunes he was released a few weeks from the end of the following season and joined Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity for the final day of the season. In the summer he signed for Trinity on a permanent contract and remained with the Holy Blues for two seasons before signing for Alfreton Town in the summer of 2012. After a year with Alfreton, Barnes re-signed for Gainsborough. After moving from Gainsborough Barnes joined Harrogate Town for one season before joining Buxton in August 2015. After leaving Buxton in June 2016 he signed for Matlock Town.
