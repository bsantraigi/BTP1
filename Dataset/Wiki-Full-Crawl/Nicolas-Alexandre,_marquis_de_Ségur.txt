Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de Sgur (16951755) was a Bordeaux wine maker who during his lifetime was known as the "Prince of Vines" due to his ownership of some of the most famous Bordeaux chateaus-including Chteau Lafite, Chteau Latour, Chteau Mouton and Chteau Calon-Sgur. A hundred years after his death, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 would designate Lafite and Latour as First Growths, Mouton as a second growth and Calon-Sgur as a third growth.
