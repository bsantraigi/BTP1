"#1 Crush" is a song by American rock band Garbage, released internationally as a B-side to their debut single "Vow" (1995), and in the United Kingdom on the B-side to second single "Subhuman" (1995).
In 1996, the track was remixed by Nellee Hooper and Marius de Vries for the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's modernised William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet film adaptation. The remix of "#1 Crush" peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks, where it stayed for four weeks, and is Garbage's sole number-one entry on any US singles chart to date. "#1 Crush" was the first of two hit singles from the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack; "Lovefool" by The Cardigans continued the success of the compilation. In 1997, "#1 Crush" was later nominated for Best Song from a Movie at the MTV Movie Awards.
In 2007, the remix of "#1 Crush" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album Absolute Garbage.
