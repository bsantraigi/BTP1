Richard Barwell (8 October 1741   2 September 1804) was an early trader with the East India Company and amassed one of the largest fortunes in early British India.
Barwell was the son of William Barwell, governor of Bengal in 1748, and afterwards a director of the East India Company and Sheriff of Surrey in 1768. His family, which apparently came from Kegworth, Leicestershire, had been connected with the East for generations.
