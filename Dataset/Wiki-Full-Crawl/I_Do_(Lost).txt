"I Do" is the sixth episode of the third season of Lost, and the 55th episode overall. It aired on November 8, 2006, on ABC. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Tucker Gates. The character of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, where her brief marriage to a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion), is shown. In the present events, Jack Shephard  (Matthew Fox) considers whether or not to perform surgery on Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), and is motivated by Kate's claims that if he does not comply, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) will be killed.
This was the last episode to air before a 13-week hiatus, so it was written so that it would fit as a "mini-series finale", and also had a major theme in the contrast between Kate's relationships with Kevin and Sawyer. "I Do" gained mostly positive reviews, with much praise to the cliffhanger ending, and had 17.15 million American viewers upon release.
