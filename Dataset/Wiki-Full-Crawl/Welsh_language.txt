Welsh (Cymraeg; [kmrai] (listen)) or y Gymraeg (Welsh pronunciation: [ mrai]) is a member of the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages. It is spoken natively in Wales, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina). Historically, it has also been known in English as "Cambrian", "Cambric" and "Cymric".Of usual residents in Wales aged three and over, 19.0% were able to speak Welsh according to the United Kingdom Census 2011. According to the 2001 Census, 20.8 per cent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh. This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011  from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively. However, according to the Welsh Language Use Survey 201315, 24 per cent of people aged three and over living in Wales were able to speak Welsh, implying a possible increase in the prevalence of the Welsh language since the 2011 census.The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales, making it the only language that is de jure official in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being de facto official. The Welsh language, along with English, is also a de jure official language of the National Assembly for Wales.
