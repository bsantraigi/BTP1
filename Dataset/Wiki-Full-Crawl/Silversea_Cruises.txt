Silversea Cruises is a privately owned mid-market cruise line with its headquarters in Monaco.  Founded in 1994, it pioneered all-inclusive cruising with its first ship, Silver Cloud. In June 2018, it was announced that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the parent company of Royal Caribbean International, had acquired a 67% controlling stake in the cruise line. Executive control will remain in Monaco.Silversea's co-founders, owners and operators are the Lefebvre family of Rome, Italy. They will remain on the executive board of the cruise line under Royal Caribbean ownership. As of early 2014, the company had eight boutique cruise ships, each of which carries only 100 to 540 passengers. In 2017, Silversea added the slightly larger (596 passenger) Silver Muse, for a total of nine all-suite ships.
