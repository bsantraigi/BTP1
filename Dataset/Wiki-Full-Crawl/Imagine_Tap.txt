Imagine Tap! is a musical revue developed by Derick K. Grant (director/choreographer), Zane Mark (music director/supervisor), Aaron Tolson (associate choreographer/co-creator/asst producer), and Channing Cook Holmes (assistant music director).  It opened at the Harris Theater for Music and Dance in Chicago, IL on July 11, 2006 and closed on August 6, 2006.  
This show is unique because it is one of the few big-budget all-tap dance revues since Bring in 'da Noise/Bring in 'da Funk, of which Derick K. Grant was dance captain for the original Broadway cast.
