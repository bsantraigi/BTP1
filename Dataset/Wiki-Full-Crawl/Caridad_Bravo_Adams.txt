She became a chair member of the Ateneo Mexicano de Mujeres and later moved back to Cuba, where she wrote the radionovela Yo no creo en los hombres, which was adapted in Mexico for telenovelas in 1969 and 1988. Upon the rise of Fidel Castro, she returned to Mexico, where she would remain the rest of her life. Back in Mexico, she wrote Corazn salvaje, a novel that has been adapted to the screen twice and as a telenovela four times (including once as Juan del Diablo in Puerto Rico). She then wrote La intrusa, Bodas de odio and other novels that earned her important awards.
