"Wild Tiger Woman" is a song recorded by the Move, and as with all the other A-sides of their singles, written by Roy Wood. It was much heavier than their usual style, bearing the unmistakable influence of Jimi Hendrix, whom the group greatly admired and had often played on the same bill with. Session musician Nicky Hopkins played piano.
According to Trevor Burton, the group's bass guitarist, "It had the heavier rock'n'roll sound we should have been playing all along, and I really thought it was on its way to the very top."Unlike their first four singles, which had all reached the UK top five, it did not even make the Top 40. A factor in this failure to chart may have lay in the lyrics which included the line "tied to the bed, she's waiting to be fed", which led to the single being banned from Radio 1.  Another factor was that the single's mono mix was muffled, as compared to prior Move singles. (A recent first-time stereo mix shows that the tune was nicely recorded, just initially poorly mixed.)
Its failure was a disappointment to the rest of the group, who conceded that it had been something of a mistake, and that the more melodic B-side, "Omnibus", would have been a more suitable A-side instead. They announced that they would probably disband if their subsequent single did likewise. The song that they chose for it, "Blackberry Way", became a number 1 hit, however, and so the group did not disband until 1972, when they were supplanted by Electric Light Orchestra.
