Family Brown was a Canadian country music band founded in 1967 by Joe Brown (vocals, bass guitar), along with his son Barry (vocals, guitar) and daughters Lawanda and Tracey (vocals), as well as Dave Dennison (guitar) and Ron Sparling (drums). Between 1967 and 1990, the band charted several singles in both Canada and the United States. The band also won eighteen Canadian Country Music Association awards, the most received by any artist. After disbanding, former member Tracey Brown charted both as a solo artist and as a member of the group Prescott-Brown.
