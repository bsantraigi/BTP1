"Kiss the Girl" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman for Walt Disney Pictures' 28th animated feature film The Little Mermaid (1989). Originally recorded by American actor Samuel Wright in his film role as Sebastian, "Kiss the Girl" is a calypso ballad; the song's lyrics encourage a young man to kiss his female love interest before it is too late.
"Kiss the Girl" had a mostly positive reception. The song was nominated for both an Academy and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, but lost both to "Under the Sea", another song from The Little Mermaid soundtrack.
