Va ska man ta livet av sig fr nr man nd inte fr hra snacket eftert? (English: Why take one's life when one can't hear the chat afterwards?) is the third album by the Swedish pop and rock artist Magnus Uggla. It was released in 1977.
The rebellious "Jag skiter" ("I Don't Give a Damn") became a smash hit among Swedish youth.
The song "Balladen om 70-talets strsta rockband" ("The Ballad of the '70s Greatest Rockband") is about a Mott the Hoople concert Magnus Uggla attended in 1971.
The song "Varning P Stan" ("Danger Downtown") became Uggla's first hit single and was later recorded in English with the name "Hit the Girls on the Run". Uggla has stated that he was inspired by Mott the Hoople's song "All the Way from Memphis" when he wrote "Varning P Stan".
"Jazzgossen" is a Karl Gerhard cover.
