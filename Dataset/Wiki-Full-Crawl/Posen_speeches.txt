The Posen speeches were two secret speeches made by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, on 4 and 6 October 1943 in the town hall of Posen (Polish: Pozna), in German-occupied Poland. The recordings are the first known documents in which a high-ranking German member of the Nazi government spoke of the ongoing extermination of the Jews in extermination camps. They demonstrate that the German government wanted, planned and carried out the Holocaust.
