"Real Cool World" is a song from the soundtrack of the film Cool World, performed by David Bowie. Released on 10 August 1992, it represented his first new solo material since Tin Machine dissolved.
The track marked a reunion with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, with whom Bowie began working in the summer of 1992. The bulk of the tracks resulting from their collaboration were released on Bowies 1993 album Black Tie White Noise. ("Real Cool World" was included as a bonus track on some reissues of Black Tie White Noise).
"Real Cool World" was issued in a variety of mixes, and paired with a video of clips from Cool World, but was overall a rather low-key release, resulting in a UK chart showing of No. 53.
In March 2010, a digital download version of the single was announced for release in June 2010.
