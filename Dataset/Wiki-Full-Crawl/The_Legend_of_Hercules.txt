The Legend of Hercules is a 2014 American 3D action fantasy film directed by Renny Harlin, written by Daniel Giat and Sean Hood, and starring Kellan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, Roxanne McKee, and Liam Garrigan. It was one of two Hollywood-studio Hercules films released in 2014, alongside Paramount Pictures' and MGM's co-production Hercules, released six months earlier on January 10, 2014. The Legend of Hercules was a box-office bomb and received extremely negative reviews, unlike Hercules, which was a modest box-office success and opened to far stronger reviews.
