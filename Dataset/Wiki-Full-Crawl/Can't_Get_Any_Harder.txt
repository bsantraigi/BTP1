"Can't Get Any Harder" is a song recorded by James Brown. It was written and produced by members of C+C Music Factory and Leaders of the New School and appeared as the lead track on Brown's 1992 album Universal James. It was poorly received by critics; Allmusic described it as "strain[ing] for rap credibility", while Entertainment Weekly dismissed it as "junky". A maxi single containing several remixes of the song was released in 1993 and charted #76 R&B. It was Brown's last charting single in the United States.
