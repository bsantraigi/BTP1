"Mad About You" is a song by the Belgian band Hooverphonic, released as the lead single from their third studio album, The Magnificent Tree (2000). "Mad About You" is often considered the band's masterpiece and its biggest worldwide success.
The song features a sweeping string arrangement that typifies the trip hop genre. It is also similar in style to a Bond-style film theme, with its dramatic orchestration and lyrics. The song is about a forbidden love, an idea also conveyed in the video, with the lyrics of "Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about you".
"Mad About You" was used in the soundtrack for the films Driven (2001), New Best Friend (2002), A Lot Like Love (2005) and Ma premire fois (2012).
It was also used in an episode of a TV show Cold Case (season 3, episode 5).
Cantonese pop singer Joey Yung covered the song in Cantonese on her 2002 album Something About You.
