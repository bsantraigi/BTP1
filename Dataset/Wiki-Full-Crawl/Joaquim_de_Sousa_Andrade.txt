Joaquim de Sousa Andrade, better known by his pseudonym Sousndrade (July 9, 1833  April 20, 1902), was a Brazilian poet, adept of the "Condorist" movement. His poetry, exceedingly innovative for the time it was published, is now considered an early example of Symbolism and Modernism in Brazil.
He also designed the flag of the Brazilian State of Maranho.
