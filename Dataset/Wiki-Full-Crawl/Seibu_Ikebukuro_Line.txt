The Seibu Ikebukuro Line (, Seibu Ikebukuro-sen) is a railway line of the Japanese private railway operator Seibu Railway. It originates at Ikebukuro Station, a large railway junction in north-western Tokyo, extending to northwest suburbs as far as Tokorozawa, Saitama, and nominally terminates at Agano Station.
The Seibu Chichibu Line from Agano to Seibu Chichibu Station is an extension. The operation is largely divided into two sections:  from Ikebukuro to Hann Station and from Hann to Seibu Chichibu Station.
