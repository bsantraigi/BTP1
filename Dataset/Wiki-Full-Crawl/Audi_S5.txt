The Audi S5 is the high-performance variant of Audi's A5. It is also the coup, cabriolet, and five-door fastback versions of the fourth-generation (B8) Audi S4 saloon and estate models.
Like all Audi "S" cars, they are only available as standard with Audi's quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, here in S5 using a Torsen-based centre diff system.Most versions of the S5 are manufactured at Audi's plant in Ingolstadt, Germany; they are available as a coup, cabriolet, and five-door sportback, which was previously not available in North America until the 2018 model year, which was released in the United States in mid 2017. The cabriolets are built at Audi's factory in Neckarsulm, Germany. The Chassis in an S5 and A5 are different.
