Ten Feet High is Andrea Corr's debut solo album. Previously titled Present, the album was produced by Nellee Hooper whose credits include U2, Gwen Stefani, Madonna, and Bjrk and was executively produced by U2's Bono. String arrangements were by Anne Dudley and Michael Jennings. The album was released on 25 June 2007 with the lead single "Shame on You (to Keep My Love from Me)" released on 18 June 2007.
All the songs on the album were composed by Andrea herself save for a cover of the first Squeeze hit "Take Me I'm Yours".
Sales have generally been very poor despite the high promotion for the album and generally favourable reviews. The album failed to make an impact in most of Europe and Australia where it peaked at a very low #98 on the Australian ARIA Album Chart. The album peaked at #38 in the UK but soon dropped down the chart. The album achieved quite good sales in Spain, peaking inside the Top 10 within the first week after it was released.
