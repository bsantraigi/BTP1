Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter (Dutch pronunciation: [mxil adrijanson d rytr]; 24 March 1607  29 April 1676) was a Dutch admiral. He was one of the most skilled admirals in history, most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. He fought the English and French and scored several major victories against them, the best known probably being the Raid on the Medway. The pious De Ruyter was very much loved by his sailors and soldiers; from them his most significant nickname derived: Bestevar (older Dutch for 'grandfather'.)
