He enlisted in 1781 and, in his 30-year career, he saw action at the major French defeats and victories in Europe. He fought in Andr Massna's Army of Switzerland, where he participated in the Winterthur and First and Second Battles of Zrich, the campaigns of 1806 against Prussia, and Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

He was buried at the Panthon, and his name is listed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
