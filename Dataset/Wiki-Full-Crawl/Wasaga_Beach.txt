Wasaga Beach (variant: Wasaga) is a town in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. Situated along the longest (14 km) freshwater beach in the world, it is a popular summer tourist destination, located along the southern end of Georgian Bay, approximately two hours north of Toronto; and neighbours, to the west, Collingwood and The Blue Mountains which attract visitors much of the year. The town is situated along a very long sandy beach on Nottawasaga Bay in Georgian Bay and the winding Nottawasaga River. The beaches are part of the Ontario Parks's Wasaga Beach Provincial Park; the park area totals 168 hectares (415 acres). Wasaga Beach also has many seasonal residents.
The economy has struggled for some years, particularly since a major fire in late November 2007 destroyed many of the stores, and due to a reduction in the number of tourists in an area where the primary shopping season is three to four months per year. In March 2017, the town passed its Downtown Development Master Plan, a 20-year strategy for significant redevelopment of the tourist area and adding a downtown to the business area. The goal is to improve tourism, diversify the economy, and rid itself of the "party town" image.
