"The Down Town" is a song by Days of the New and the second single from their self-titled debut album. Like its predecessor, the song reached #1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1998 and is a concert staple. "The Down Town" is also the third track on the band's Definitive Collection released in 2008.
The song is arguably the second most popular single from the band's debut album and certainly one of their best known songs overall. It is also one of the album's upbeat tracks while bearing an aggressive chorus. Lyrically, "The Down Town" ambiguously details a town of drug users who are afraid of change and suppressive of the narrator. The phrase "to bring me down" is rebelliously shouted throughout the chorus. A mention of pointless and rejected concern over another person's well being is also addressed during the bridge. Given this theme of negativity, the "Down Town" song title may be intended as a double entendre or pun.
