Pedro Avils Prez, also known as "El Len de la Sierra" (English: "The Mountain Lion"), was a Mexican drug lord in the state of Sinaloa in the late 1960s. He is considered to be the first generation of major Mexican drug smugglers of marijuana. He was also the first known drug lord to use an aircraft to smuggle drugs to the United States.Second generation Sinaloan traffickers such as Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo would claim they learned all they knew about drug trafficking while serving in the Avils organization. Killed in a shootout with the Federal Police in September 1978, it is believed Avils was set up by Fonseca, the cartel's treasurer. Rafael Caro Quintero, Aviles' foreman in Chihuahua began acquiring marijuana and poppy plantations. Corruption of state officials was brokered by Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo, an emerging capo who had spent time in Sinaloa working as a Sinaloan State Police trooper and serving as body guard to Leopoldo Snchez Celis, governor of Sinaloa.
