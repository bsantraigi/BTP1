RTV BK Telekom (Serbian Cyrillic:     ) was a privately owned radio-television company based in Belgrade, Serbia. It functioned as a privately owned, revenue generating media outlet with a "G" rating (general audiences or general interest station) and without editorial or content restrictions. It was launched two and a half months following the launch of RTV Pink.
Prior to its license revocation in late April 2006 and subsequent folding during March 2007, BKTV had significant viewership all over Serbia. According to Nielsen Research data for the calendar year 2005 (its last full year of regular terrestrial broadcasting), BKTV held 11.2% of the Serbian TV audience with a daily average of 3.2 million people tuning into its programmes, which meant it was the third most watched TV network in Serbia at the time behind Pink (22.5% market share and 3.7 million daily viewers on average) and RTS1 (22.4% market share and 3.9 million daily viewers on average). BK was well ahead of fourth placed B92 (6.8%) and fifth placed RTS2 (6.3%).
The station's most watched programme ever was the live broadcast of Slobodan Miloevi's funeral on March 18, 2006 when 2,688,622
viewers (25.2% of the Serbian television market) tuned into BK.
