The Maui alauahio (Paroreomyza montana newtoni) also known as the Maui Nui alauahio or Maui creeper, is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper.  It is endemic to Hawaii. The name, Maui alauahio, is somewhat misleading because the species seems to have occurred on most, if not all, parts of the ancient Maui Nui.  Its natural habitats are dry, mesic and wet forests, as well as high and low shrublands and plantations, and can be seen at Polipoli Springs State Park, and Hosmer's Grove at Haleakal National Park. It is threatened by habitat loss. Their call is a loud "cheep", and their song consists of a repeated whistled phrase "whichy-wheesee-whurdy-whew".
