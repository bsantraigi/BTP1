Temporary Music is the 1979 debut EP and 1981 debut album by the New York based No Wave music group Material.
The band had previously worked with Daevid Allen on New York Gong's 1979 About Time album. The Temporary Music 1 EP was recorded in 1979 and the Temporary Music 2 EP in 1980. The two EPs were compiled together for Material's debut album, two slightly different versions being released, one on Red Rec. which also included the "Discourse" single, and one on Celluloid which simply put each EP on either side of the album. Some CD versions include the "Detached"/"Ciquiri" single, recorded with Robert Quine.
