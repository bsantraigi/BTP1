The Numeralla River, a perennial river that is part of the Murrumbidgee catchment within the MurrayDarling basin, is located in the Monaro region of New South Wales, Australia.
The name of the river is claimed to derive from an Aboriginal word meaning "valley of plenty", but Flavia Hodges has called this etymology "highly suspect."
