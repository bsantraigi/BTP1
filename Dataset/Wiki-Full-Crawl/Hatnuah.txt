Hatnuah (Hebrew: , lit. The Movement) is a liberal political party in Israel formed by former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to present an alternative to voters frustrated by the stalemate in the IsraeliPalestinian peace process.The party was formed by dissidents in Kadima, which Livni, who had led the party's progressive wing, headed until March 2012 when she lost a leadership primary election to rival Shaul Mofaz, who was part of the party's more conservative wing. Although the establishment of the party was announced in late 2012, it is actually based on the infrastructure of Hetz, a faction that broke away from Shinui in 2006. Relatively close in ideology to Yesh Atid and the Labor Party, which focused mostly on domestic and socioeconomic issues in their 2013 campaigns, Hatnuah stands out for its aggressive push for a pragmatic peace settlement with the Palestinians.In the 2013 legislative election, Hatnuah ran on a joint list with the Green Movement, and incorporated many of its core ideals into the party's platform. Hatnuah's 2013 platform emphasized ArabIsraeli peace, social justice, environmental protection, the integration of all citizens into the military and workforce, and religious pluralism.In the 2015 legislative election, it ran on a joint electoral list with the Labor Party called the Zionist Union, which became the second-largest parliamentary group.
