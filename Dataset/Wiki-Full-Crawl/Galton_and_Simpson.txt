Ray Galton OBE (17 July 1930  5 October 2018), and Alan Simpson OBE (27 November 1929  8 February 2017), were an English comedy scriptwriting partnership. They met in 1948 whilst recuperating from tuberculosis at the Milford Sanatorium, near Godalming in Surrey. The sitcom Get Well Soon (co-written by Galton) concerns their shared experiences at the facility. They are best known for their work with comedian Tony Hancock on radio and television between 1954 and 1961, and their long-running television situation comedy, Steptoe and Son, eight series of which were aired between 1962 and 1974.
