The Rupert River is one of the largest rivers in Quebec, Canada. From its headwaters in Lake Mistassini, the largest natural lake in Quebec, it flows 556 kilometres (345 mi) west into Rupert Bay on James Bay. The Rupert drains an area of 43,400 square kilometres (16,800 sq mi).
There is some extremely large whitewater on the river, but paddlers can avoid much of it by portage routes on the side.  The most impressive falls, which cannot be avoided except by portaging, are the "Oatmeal Rapids" right at the James Bay Road (a set of cascades dropping 18 m (59 ft)) and "The Fours" near the end of the river (a 24 m (79 ft) drop).
The Rupert has long been an important river for the Cree of the area.  Every year, a group of Cree youth from the village of Waskaganish, at the mouth of the Rupert, travel up the river to Lake Nemiscau.
Major tributaries of the Rupert are (in downstream order):

Natastan River (Rivire Natastan)
Lemare River (Rivire Lemare) - 1,290 km2 (500 sq mi) subbasin
Marten River (Rivire  la Marte) - 4,505 km2 (1,739 sq mi) subbasin
Nemiscau River (Rivire Nemiscau) - 3,015 km2 (1,164 sq mi) subbasin
