Edward Richard Sprigg Canby (November 9, 1817  April 11, 1873) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War.
In 18611862, Canby commanded the Department of New Mexico, defeating the Confederate General Henry Hopkins Sibley at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, forcing him to retreat to Texas. At the war's end, he took the surrender of Generals Richard Taylor and Edmund Kirby Smith. As commander of the Pacific Northwest in 1873, he was assassinated during peace talks with the Modoc, who were refusing to move from their California homelands. He was the only United States general to be killed during the Indian Wars.
Canby was regarded as an administrator, more than a leader. General Ulysses S. Grant believed that he lacked aggression, but declared him irreplaceable for his knowledge of army regulations and constitutional law.
