Plead the Fifth is the fifth studio album by American alternative metal band Taproot. Originally planned for an April 13, 2010 release, it was delayed to May 11. The album marks Taproot's first release through Victory Records, having signed in November 2009. "Fractured (Everything I Said Was True)" was released as the lead single, followed by "Release Me". The confirmed track listing was released on the Victory Records website.
Guitarist Mike DeWolf described the album's sound as a return to the heavy nature of Taproot's early material:

"We're definitely making it as heavy as possible and aggressive while still keeping a lot of the beautiful melodies and just the general beauty of things in it. We're using a lot more of our baritone guitars, which was sort of the signature of the Gift and Welcome [2002] years, so that immediately makes things a lot heavier."The album debuted at number 107 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 5,500.
