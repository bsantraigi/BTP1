Vidzeme (pronounced [vidzeme]; Lithuanian: Videm; Livonian: Vidm) is one of the historical and cultural regions of Latvia. Literally meaning "the Middle Land", it is situated in north-central Latvia north of the Daugava River. Sometimes in German, it is also known as Livland, the German form from Latin Livonia, though it comprises only a small part of Medieval Livonia and about half (the Latvian part) of Swedish Livonia.
Vidzemes gubera  Livland Governorate is also bigger than Vidzeme, since it corresponds roughly to Swedish Livonia.
