U.S. Route 1 (US 1) is a major northsouth U.S. Highway that serves the East Coast of the United States. It runs 2,369 miles (3,813 km), from Key West, Florida north to Fort Kent, Maine, at the CanadaUS border, making it the longest northsouth road in the United States. US 1 is generally paralleled by I-95, though the former is significantly farther west (inland) between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. The highway connects most of the major cities of the East Coastincluding Miami, Jacksonville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston and Portland, passing from the Southeastern United States to New England.
While US 1 is generally the easternmost of the main northsouth U.S. Highways, parts of several others occupy corridors closer to the ocean.  When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US 1 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway, which followed the Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain north of Augusta, Georgia. At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers. Construction of the Interstate Highway system gradually changed the use and character of US 1, and I-95 became the major northsouth East Coast highway by the late 1960s.
