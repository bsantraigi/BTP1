Paiute (; also Piute) refers to three non-contiguous groups of indigenous peoples of the Great Basin.  These three groups, although related within the Numic group of Uto-Aztecan languages, do not form a single node within that group.  The term "Paiute" does not refer to a single, unique, unified group of Great Basin tribes, but is a historical label.

Southern Paiute of northern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah
Mono people of east central California, divided into Owens Valley Paiute (Eastern Mono) and Western Mono (Monache)
