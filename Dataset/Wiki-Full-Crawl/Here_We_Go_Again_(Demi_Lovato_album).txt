Here We Go Again is the second studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on July 21, 2009, through Hollywood Records. Unlike her previous album, Don't Forget (2008), Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as she wanted to work with different people and give the album a personal approach. Lovato collaborated for the album with established songwriters and producers, such as E. Kidd Bogart, Gary Clark, Toby Gad, John Mayer, Jon McLaughlin, Lindy Robbins and John Fields, who produced her previous album Don't Forget.
Here We Go Again derives mainly from the pop rock genre, mixed with influences of power pop, jazz-pop, soul and pop. Lovato described the album as more "relaxed" than her previous album, while exploring more mature sounds and lyrics. Critical reception of the album was positive; critics praised Lovato for not relying on vocal manipulations and instead showing off her natural ability. Although some critics called the album catchy, others felt that it was predictable and at times too much alike Kelly Clarkson. In the United States, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 108,000 copies during its first week of release. Since its release, the album has sold over 500,000 copies in the US, and had been certified gold by RIAA. Internationally, the album peaked inside the top 40 on charts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, New Zealand and Spain. It was certified platinum in Brazil. 
"Here We Go Again" was released as the lead single from the album in June 23, 2009 and was Lovato's first solo single to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 15, and has been certified platinum by RIAA. "Remember December" was the second and final single only in Europe in January 18, 2010.
