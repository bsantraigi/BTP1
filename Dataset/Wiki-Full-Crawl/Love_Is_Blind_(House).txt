"Love Is Blind" is the fourteenth episode of the season eight of House and the 169th overall. The episode debuted in Canada on Global on February 27, 2012, and aired three weeks later in the United States on Fox on March 19, 2012.  The unusual three-week delay was a byproduct of the 2012 Daytona 500 rain delay of 30 hours (7 PM EDT start time February 27).
