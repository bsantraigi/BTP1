Stevan "Saraga" Lukaevi (1860-1932) was a Montenegrin politician, merchant and actor. He served as mayor of Podgorica between 1893 and 1895.
He originally immigrated from Serbia to Podgorica. He produced pearl essence from the scales of bleaks. He dried the scales and exported large quantities of his product to Serbia.Lukaevi was one of the founders of the Podgorica Theater Society (Podgoriko pozorino drutvo).Lukaevi was featured in the play "Maksim Crnojevi" (written by Serbian playwright Laza Kosti) in the title role as Maksim Crnojevi. The play was performed in Podgorica ca. 5 April 1885 (Orthodox Easter). A writer for the Glas Crnogorca newspaper in Podgorica wrote in his report that despite the barriers of local dialects and the difficulty of fully mimicking everyone's movements, the actors played their roles fairly well. They also noted that foreigners watching the play could not believe that the actors were debutants.Lukaevi was a relative of Montenegrin king Nicholas I and a descendant of Serbian revolutionary Karaore Petrovi.
