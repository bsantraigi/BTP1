Herbert Joakim "Jocke" Berg (born 16 March 1970 in Eskilstuna, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the lead singer of Swedish Rock/Pop band Kent.  Berg rarely gives interviews, saying in one:  less is more.  Berg has tended to write lyrics in Swedish because he wants to avoid the use of clich-ridden English lyrics, which often happens when Swedish artists sing in English.  Kents lyrics contributed to their development from indie band to broad mass appeal as songs in Swedish are preferred among the slightly older population that Kent has attracted, according to an academic who has studied the band in their sociological and national context.
