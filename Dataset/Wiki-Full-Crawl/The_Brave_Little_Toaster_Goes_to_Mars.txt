The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars is the name of both a children's book by Thomas M. Disch and a film based on it. Both are sequels to the book, The Brave Little Toaster. The film was produced by Hyperion Animation and distributed by Walt Disney Home Video and released in 1998. It featured the last performances of actors DeForest Kelley and Thurl Ravenscroft before their deaths in 1999 and 2005 respectively.
Although set after the events of The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue, Goes to Mars was the first of the two sequels to the original film, as both were in production around the same time and the latter was the first to finish production.
