Wild is the fifth full-length studio album by British Pagan rock band Inkubus Sukkubus.
"Death & The Virgin" is a hidden track that plays about 2 minutes after "Delilah" finishes.  Also, "Atrocity" is the only Inkubus Sukkubus song besides "Resurrection Machine" and "Jerusalem" which features Tony McKormack on lead vocals instead of Candia Ridley.
