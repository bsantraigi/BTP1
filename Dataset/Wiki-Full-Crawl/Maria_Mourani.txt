Maria Mourani (born May 19, 1969) was an independent Member of Parliament in the federal riding of Ahuntsic in Canada. She was formerly a member of the Bloc Qubcois before leaving the party over its support for the proposed Quebec Charter of Values. She joined the New Democratic Party in November 2014 but was not a member of the party's caucus due to the party's policy against crossing the floor; she stood for the NDP in the 2015 Canadian federal election, but did not win. Mourani was the first woman of Lebanese origin elected to the Canadian House of Commons. In 2017, she became the Quebec representative in the Permanent Delegation of Canada at UNESCO.
