Mysore State was a separate state within the Union of India from 1948 until 1956 with Mysore as its capital. 
The state was considerably enlarged in 1956 when it became a linguistically homogeneous Kannada-speaking state in 1956, within the Union of India. It was subsequently incorporated into the state of Karnataka.
