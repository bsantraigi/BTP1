The El Caso Lookout Complex is located in the Gila National Forest north of Apache Creek, New Mexico. Built in 1934 by the Works Progress Administration, the complex was one of three New Deal-era forest fire lookouts built in Catron County. The other two are the Mangas Mountain Lookout Complex near Old Horse Springs and the Bearwallow Mountain Lookout Complex near Mogollon.
