Basick Records is a British record label founded in 2005 by Nathan "Barley" Phillips and his half brother Jake Smith. Their business has since expanded into the Invictus Music & Media group, which includes Basick Records itself, the hardcore punk-oriented label Destroy Everything and the PR company Hold Tight! PR. Basick Records' first release was a compilation album, entitled, "Do You Feel This?", released on 8 August 2005. The first band to be signed to Basick was Fellsilent. They were also the first label to release material from Enter Shikari.
In 2011, Basick made a global distribution deal (excluding North America) with Warner ADA. Then, on 17 January 2012, they announced a North American distribution partnership with Prosthetic Records, in which selections from Basick's back catalog and all forthcoming releases would see distribution in North America from Prosthetic.
