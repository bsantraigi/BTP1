Talbot or Clment-Talbot Limited was a London automobile manufacturer founded in 1903. Clment-Talbot's products were named just Talbot from shortly after introduction, but the business remained Clment-Talbot Limited until 1938 when it was renamed Sunbeam-Talbot Limited. The founders, Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury and Adolphe Clment-Bayard, reduced their financial interests in their Clment-Talbot business during the First World War.
Soon after the end of the war, Clment-Talbot was brought into a combine named S T D Motors. Shortly afterward, S T D Motors' French products were renamed Talbot instead of Darracq.
In the mid-1930s, with the collapse of S T D Motors, Rootes bought the London Talbot factory and Antonio Lago bought the Paris Talbot factory, Lago producing vehicles under the marques Talbot and Talbot-Lago. Rootes renamed Clment-Talbot Limited Sunbeam-Talbot Limited in 1938, and stopped using the brand name Talbot in the mid-1950s. The Paris factory closed a few years later.
Ownership of the marque came by a series of takeovers to Peugeot S.A., which revived use of the Talbot name from 1978 until 1994.
