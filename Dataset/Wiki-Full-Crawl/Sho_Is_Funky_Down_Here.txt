Sho Is Funky Down Here is the 35th studio album by American musician James Brown, released in 1971 on King Records. It was #26 on the Billboard R&B Albums chart and #137 on The Billboard 200 in 1971.It's a very atypical album for James Brown. All instrumental and full of heavy fuzzed-out guitars in a jazzy psychedelic rock style, resembling the first records by Funkadelic. All songs are by James Brown and David Matthews and the record is somewhat a second album by Matthews' Grodeck Whipperjenny group. David Matthews worked as the band leader for James Brown at the time.
