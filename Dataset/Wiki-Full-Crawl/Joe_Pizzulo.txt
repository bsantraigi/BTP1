His singing partners in that band were Buddy Cattafa and Debbie Komara. He later became a member of Brainchild. He eventually moved to California in 1974 and started a new band called White Licorice. By the time 1979 came around, he was touring with Alice Cooper as a background singer. His career quickly took off after that with his recording of "Never Gonna Let You Go" for Srgio Mendes.
Pizzulo's daughter auditioned in the seventh season of The Voice under the name of Sugar Joans and earned a spot in coach Gwen Stefani's team.
