"Superbeast" is a promotional single off Rob Zombie's solo debut, Hellbilly Deluxe. The song was co-written by Charlie Clouser, formerly of Nine Inch Nails. It also appears on Rob Zombie's Past, Present & Future, the greatest hits album The Best of Rob Zombie, and two remixes are contained on American Made Music to Strip By. The track appeared in the horror film Valentine in 2001 and the action/horror film End of Days in 1999. The song was played in the background of the trailer of Godzilla 2000: Millennium. The "Girl on a Motorcycle" remix of the song was frequently used in commercials for ECW T-shirts and future events. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1999. On January 4, 2008, the song "Superbeast" was used to introduce the "Abyss vs. Manabu Nakanishi" match at Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo, Japan.
The song was covered by Transient for The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie in 2002 and was covered again in 2011 by Suicide Silence for the digital edition of The Black Crown.
The lyrics "Move the jaw, cry aloud, bound up the dead triumphantly" may be a reference to Edgar Allan Poe's "The Premature Burial" in which Poe says, "The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead."
