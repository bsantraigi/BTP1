"No Sleeep" is a song recorded by American singer Janet Jackson for her eleventh studio album Unbreakable (2015). Co-written and produced by Jackson and her long-time collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, it is the first record to be released under Jackson's independent label Rhythm Nation Records, distributed by BMG Rights Management. It was made available as the lead single from the album digitally on June 22, 2015, in addition to vinyl copies being sold on Jackson's official website in conjunction with pre-sale orders for the studio album and Unbreakable World Tour concert tickets. Lyrically, the song depicts Jackson longing to reunite with her lover, anticipating that when she does, the couple will get "no sleep". Due to its slow tempo and sentimentality, it has been described as embodying traits of the quiet storm radio style. 
The album version of the song features additional verses from American rapper J. Cole, and was used in the accompanying music video which premiered on July 24, 2015. Directed by Dave Meyers, its minimalist aesthetic and production has been compared to the music video for "That's the Way Love Goes" (1993). Jackson's solo version of the single debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 67, marking her 40th entry on the chart. It also debuted on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 18. The album version featuring J. Cole enabled it to re-enter the Hot 100 with a new peak position at number 63, while also topping the US Adult R&B Songs chart.
