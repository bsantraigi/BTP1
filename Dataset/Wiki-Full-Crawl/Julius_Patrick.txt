Julius Patrick, Jr. (May 16, 1938  November 26, 2006) was the African-American Democratic mayor of Boyce, in northern Rapides Parish, who died in a head-on collision in a chain-reaction accident on Interstate 10 in Ascension Parish near Gramercy in south Louisiana. Patrick was first elected mayor of Boyce, a community of 1,200, in 1978. He served for twenty-eight consecutive years, while he was simultaneously a full-time educator until his retirement from the Rapides Parish School Board, based in Alexandria.
Motorist Mercuria J. S. Colomb (born 1978) of St. Rose in St. Charles Parish allegedly started the chain-reaction accident. She first eluded state police but later turned herself in to authorities. Colomb was driving a car that turned into an eastbound SUV. The impact cause her vehicle to cross the interstate median, sideswipe a westbound oncoming car, and then crash head-on into the car driven by Patrick. The mayor was killed instantly, according to police. Colomb was charged with negligent homicide, negligent injury, and improper lane usage. She left the crash scene headed east on Interstate 10.
