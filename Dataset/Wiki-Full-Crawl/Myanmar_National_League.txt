The MPT Myanmar National League (Burmese:   ; abbreviated MNL) is the premier national professional football league of Myanmar. In 2009, the league replaced the Myanmar Premier League, which consisted only of 14 Yangon-based football clubs, with eight professional clubs representing different regions across the nation. On 16 May 2009, the league launched its inaugural two-month tournament, the Myanmar National League Cup 2009 in preparation for the first full season in 2010. Despite its national ambitions, the league held the MNL Cup 2009 matches in the country's two main stadiums in Yangon due to the lack of adequate facilities elsewhere. On 5 July 2009, Yadanabon FC defeated Yangon United FC in the MNL Cup final to become the first-ever MNL Champions.
The league added three clubs for the 2010 season  and one more club joined for the 2011 season, bringing the total to twelve clubs.
Two more clubs representing the Chin and Shan States will participate in the MNL season starting in January 2012.Promotion and relegation will be added by the 2014 season as the MNL looks to expand once again.
