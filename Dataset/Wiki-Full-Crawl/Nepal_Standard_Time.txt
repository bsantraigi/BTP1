Nepal Standard Time (NPT) is the time zone for Nepal. With a time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of +5:45 all over Nepal, it is one of only three time zones with a 45-minute offset from UTC. (The others are Chatham Island Standard Time, with an offset of UTC+12:45, and the unofficial Australian Central Western Time, with an offset of UTC+08:45.)NPT is an approximation of Kathmandu mean time, which is 5:41:16 ahead of UTC.  The standard meridian passes through the peak of Gaurishankar mountain about 100 km east of Kathmandu.Nepal used local solar time until 1920, in Kathmandu UTC+5:41:16. In 1920, Nepal adopted Indian Standard Time, UTC+05:30. In 1986 Nepal advanced their clocks by 15 minutes, giving them a time zone of UTC+05:45.
