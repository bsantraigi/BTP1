Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited, formerly BAA is the United Kingdom-based operator of Heathrow Airport. The company also operated Gatwick Airport and Stansted Airport, plus several other UK airports under its former name. It was formed by the privatisation of the British Airports Authority as BAA plc as part of Margaret Thatcher's moves to privatise government-owned assets, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
BAA plc was bought in 2006 by a consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish firm specialising in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport, urban and services infrastructure. In March 2009 the company was required to sell Gatwick and Stansted airports, and over the following years sold all its airports other than Heathrow. The company was renamed Heathrow Airport Holdings in 2012 to reflect its main business.
The company's head office is located in The Compass Centre on the grounds of Heathrow Airport in the London Borough of Hillingdon. The company makes money from charging landing fees to airlines and increasingly from ancillary operations within those airports such as retail and property.
