Barker College is a coeducational Independent Anglican, day and boarding school, located in Hornsby, a North Shore suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1890 by the Reverend Henry Plume at Kurrajong Heights. In 2016 Barker announced a transition to full Coeducation, commencing in 2018 with girls in Pre Kindergarten and Kindergarten, Yr3 in 2019 and Yr7 in 2020. It currently has boys only from Yr1 to Yr9 and is co-educational from Years 10 to 12. The college currently caters for approximately 2100 students,  including 60 boarders from Years 10 to 12.The Council of Barker College was originally constituted by the Barker College Ordinance of 1919.  In 1939, Barker College was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Anglican Church of Australia (Bodies Corporate) Act 1938.   Therefore, though Barker College is an Anglican school, it is separately incorporated and has its own governing body.
Barker is affiliated with the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia, the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, the Independent Schools Association, and is a founding member of the Combined Associated Schools.
