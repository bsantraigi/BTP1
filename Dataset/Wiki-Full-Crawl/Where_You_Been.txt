Where You Been is the fifth official studio album by Dinosaur Jr., released on February 9, 1993. 
The song "Start Choppin'" was their biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S., and the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. This was drummer Murph's last recording with J Mascis until 2007's Beyond.
This was the only Dinosaur Jr. album between 1988's Bug and 2007's Beyond to be recorded entirely with a full band. During Dinosaur's major label years, Mascis performed most of the instruments himself on record.
The act peaked with 263,000 units sold in US.
