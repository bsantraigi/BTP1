Z is the third extended play (EP) by American singer and songwriter SZA. It was released on April 8, 2014, by Top Dawg Entertainment. After amassing two self-released mixtapes, See.SZA.Run and S, as well as meeting with members of Top Dawg Entertainment, she subsequently signed a recording contract with the indie label. The recording of the EP took place in Carson, California during the summer of 2013 with the help of her Top Dawg labelmate Isaiah Rashad, among others.
An alternative R&B and neo soul album, Z has a diverse musical style that incorporates contemporary urban genres such as soul, hip hop, and minimalist R&B, as well as 1980s synth-pop elements. Its production is characterized by layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals, which are synthetic and fluid. Its lyrics explore the complexities of romantic relationships, sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment. The album was written by SZA herself, with production handled by Mac Miller, Emile Haynie and others.
Z received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and musical style. Critics also praised the EP's lyrical content and SZA's vocals, as well as comparing the EP to the work of singer and songwriter Lorde.
Z debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number thirty-nine, selling 6,980 copies in its opening week. It peaked at number nine on the US Hip-Hop/R&B chart. To date, the EP has sold over 26,000 copies in the US.
