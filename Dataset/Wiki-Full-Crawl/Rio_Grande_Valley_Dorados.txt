The Rio Grande Valley Dorados were a professional arena football team. They began play in 2004 as an expansion member of af2, the minor league to the Arena Football League. They played their home games at Obra Homes Field at Dodge Arena in Hidalgo, Texas.
They have been fairly successful in their existence, having put together a 151 regular season in 2007 yet fell to Bossier-Shreveport in the American Conference Semifinals.
The team folded in 2009 after AF2 folded. The now-defunct Arena Football League owned the rights to the Dorados name and logo as well.  They now belong to the new Arena Football 1 league.
