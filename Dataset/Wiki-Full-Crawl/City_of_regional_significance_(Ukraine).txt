City of regional significance is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its region (i.e. oblast, Crimea). In Crimea, these cities are referred to as cities of republican significance, while in regular oblasts those municipalities are referred to as cities of oblast significance (Ukrainian:   , Misto oblasnoho znachennya). The designation of regional significance was created with the introduction of oblasts in 1932.
Such city municipality is complex and usually combines the city proper as well as the adjacent populated places. The city of regional (oblast) significance is governed by a city council known as mis'krada which is chaired by a mayor. There are instances where a municipality may include only the city alone (city proper), while in others instances a municipality may consists of its own subdivisions such as districts in city, similarly to the cities with special status or even other cities which carry designation of cities of district significance.
