The National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden is the most recent addition to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in the United States.  It is located on the National Mall between the National Gallery's West Building and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.
Completed and opened to the public on 23 May 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting several pieces from the museum's contemporary sculpture collection.  The collection is centered on a fountain which, from December to March, is converted to an ice-skating rink.  (Such a rink predated the construction of the garden.)  The outdoor Pavilion Caf lies adjacent to the garden.Laurie Olin and his firm, OLIN, were the landscape architects who redesigned the garden.
