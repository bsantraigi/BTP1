"Big Big Deal" is a song by the British singer-songwriter Steve Harley, released as his debut, non-album solo single in 1974. It was written and produced by Harley, and would be Harley's last release before his UK number one hit "Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)" in 1975. "Big Big Deal" preceded the formation of the second Cockney Rebel line-up.
