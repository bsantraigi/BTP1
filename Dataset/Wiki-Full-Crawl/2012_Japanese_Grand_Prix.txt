The 2012 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the 2012 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place at the Suzuka Circuit in Mie Prefecture, Japan on 7 October 2012 at 15:00 local time. The race was the fifteenth round of the 2012 season, and marked the 38th running of the Japanese Grand Prix.
Sebastian Vettel started the race from pole position for the fourth successive year at Suzuka, eventually leading the race from start to finish, winning by 20 seconds over Felipe Massa  who achieved his first podium since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix  in second place and Kamui Kobayashi, who achieved his first ever podium. It was also the first time a Japanese driver achieved a podium finish at the home race since Aguri Suzuki in 1990. It was also the first time a Japanese driver finished on the podium since Takuma Sato in 2004.
The race was also Vettel's second career grand slam (leading every single lap from pole position and finishing with the fastest lap of the race). His first was the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.
