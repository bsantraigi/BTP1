Compass Point Studios was founded in 1977 by Chris Blackwell, the owner of Island Records. In the late 1970s and mid-1980s, many musical artists from across the world came to the Bahamas to record music at its facilities. Many producers, including Chris Blackwell himself, used the studio to produce recordings. AC/DC's Back In Black, the third highest selling album ever, was just one of the many albums recorded there. Other well-known artists who recorded there include: Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Julio Iglesias, Serge Gainsbourg, The Rolling Stones, Etta James, Colin James, The Tragically Hip, Grace Jones, Shakira, Celine Dion, U2, Saga, Robert Palmer, Thompson Twins, Tom Tom Club, Talking Heads, Dire Straits, Electric Light Orchestra, Bob Marley, Eric Clapton, James Brown, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Roxy Music, Bonnie Tyler, Bjrk, The B-52's, Lenny Kravitz, Spandau Ballet and David Bowie.
As Chris Blackwell's other business interests steadily increased, he spent less of his time directly looking after the studio. With producer and manager Alex Sadkin's death in 1987, the studio began a period of decline. With no one overseeing the studio, studio equipment began to suffer from lack of proper maintenance and upgrades.
In 1992, Blackwell took action to save the studio by hiring Terry and Sherrie Manning, the owners and operators of a recording studio and video production house in the US. The couple oversaw all aspects of Compass Point Studios. Upon their arrival in late 1992, the Mannings began restoring the two large studios, tearing them apart and completely rewiring them with modern recording equipment.
