Shivmangal Singh 'Suman' (5 August 1915  27 November 2002) was a noted Hindi poet and academician.
Upon his death, the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, "Dr Shiv Mangal Singh Suman was not only a powerful signature in the field of Hindi poetry, but he was also the custodian of the collective consciousness of his time. His creations not only expressed the pain of his own feelings, but were also fearless constructive commentary on the issues of the era.".
