Romanian Americans (Romanian: Romni americani) are Americans who have Romanian ancestry. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 450,662 Americans indicated Romanian as their first ancestry.
Other sources provide higher estimates for the numbers of Romanian Americans in the contemporary US; for example, the Romanian-American Network Inc. supplies a rough estimate of 1.1 million who are fully or partially of Romanian ethnicity. There is also a significant number of persons of Romanian Jewish ancestry, estimated at about 225,000.
