Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District is a congressional district in the state of Pennsylvania.  It includes communities north and west of the City of Philadelphia, represented by Ryan Costello. He announced his retirement in 2018 on MSNBC, stating that he would not seek re-election. 
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional. The district's boundaries will be adjusted for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter. Democrat Chrissy Houlahan was elected in the new district's boundaries.
The district's current incarnation dates from 2002. Its strange shape brought charges of gerrymandering by Democrats who argued it "looms like a dragon descending on Philadelphia from the west, splitting up towns and communities throughout Montgomery and Berks Counties." The combination of very affluent suburban areas of Philadelphia and sparsely populated rural areas was possibly designed to capture Republican voters, but changes in voting patterns in southeastern Pennsylvania has made the District much more competitive. The District had a Cook Partisan Voting Index score of R+1 after the 2012 redistricting. It was rated D+4 before then.The redistricting of 2011/2012 changed it to include parts of Chester, Montgomery, Berks and Lebanon counties. The court-ordered map made the 6th a more compact district in Berks and Chester counties.
