Star Citizen is an upcoming multiplayer, space trading and combat game developed and published by Cloud Imperium Games for Microsoft Windows. Development of the game began in 2011 led by director Chris Roberts, and is being mostly financed from a large crowdfunding campaign of over $200 million. The game's full launch was originally anticipated to be in 2014, but significant expansion of gameplay features have led to postponement. Squadron 42, a single-player story-driven game set in the same universe as Star Citizen, is also being developed.
