Berserkers (or "berserks") were champion Vikings who are primarily reported in Swedish sagas to have fought in a trance-like fury, a characteristic which later gave rise to the English word "berserk."
These champions would often go into battle without mail coats.  Berserkers are attested to in numerous Old Norse sources, as were the lfhnar ("wolf-coats").
