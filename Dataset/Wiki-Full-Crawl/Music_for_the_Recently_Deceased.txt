Music for the Recently Deceased is the second album by Australian metalcore band I Killed the Prom Queen that was released on 31 July 2006.
In August 2005, I Killed the Prom Queen flew to Sweden to record their follow-up album, Music for the Recently Deceased. By late 2005, they had completed recording the album but in January 2006 Crafter was fired. Instead of releasing the album as it was, they decided to hire a new vocalist and replace Crafter's tracks. Ed Butcher, from United Kingdom band The Hunt for Ida Wave was recruited. New lyrics were written by Cameron and Butcher, while some lyrics that the whole band had contributed during the Crafter sessions were retained. Music for the Recently Deceased was produced by Fredrik Nordstrm, whose other credits included Dimmu Borgir, Darkest Hour, At the Gates and In Flames, and by Patrik J Sten.
The album was released on 31 July 2006 by Stomp Entertainment and peaked at #27 on the Australian ARIA Charts. In the first month of its release in the United States the album sold 1,238 copies. A video was produced for the song "Say Goodbye"
