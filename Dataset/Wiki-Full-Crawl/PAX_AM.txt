Pax Americana Recording Company, also known as PAX-AM, is a record label founded by Ryan Adams.  Established in 2004, the label released then-unpublished Adams' demo recordings.  Following Adams' fulfillment of a recording contract with Lost Highway Records in 2008, the PAX-AM label became the artist's exclusive venue for musical releases.  In early November 2010, the label re-launched its webpage and announced platforms for retail and the release of music by additional artists.
