The Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the Latin rock, alternative or urban genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".The category was originally known as the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance, and was first presented in 1998 to the Argentinian group Los Fabulosos Cadillacs for the album Fabulosos Calavera. In 2009, this category joined the Latin Urban Album category to become known as Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album.
The award was temporarily discontinued for the 2012 Grammy season due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. That year, recordings in this category were shifted to the newly formed Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album category. However, in June 2012 the Recording Academy announced that the category was to be brought back for the 55th Grammy Awards in 2013 under the (slightly revised) name of Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album.Mexican group Man are the biggest winners in this category having won the award three times. Ozomatli and Calle 13 are the other multiple award winners having won twice. Colombian duo Aterciopelados Venezuelan Latin funk band Los Amigos Invisibles and Mexican bands El Tri and Molotov share the record for most nominations without a win, with four.
