Carl Redi  (April 21 (or 23?), 1848  June 17, 1901) was a Swiss pulmonologist and at his lifetime one of the best-known physicians in Graubnden.
Redi rose to fame around the world after having treated the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson in the winters of 1880-81 and 1881-82. Stevenson praised Redi in the dedication of his poetry collection Underwoods (1887) as "the good genius of the English in his frosty mountains".
