Live at Wembley July 16, 1988 is a live concert DVD by American recording artist Michael Jackson released on September 18, 2012. The DVD was included with the Bad 25 reissue, as well as a stand-alone DVD. This is the third tour by Jackson to be released on a home format (the first two being the first leg performance of the DVD Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour and the VHS HIStory World Tour: Live in Seoul).  The recording is a performance of the Bad tour, performing songs from the album Bad. The music video for the song "Another Part of Me" features footage from other concerts in Wembley as well as Paris.
This particular concert took place on July 16, 1988, at Wembley Stadium in Wembley, London, to a sold-out crowd of 72,000, which included Diana, Princess of Wales and Charles, Prince of Wales. Jackson originally removed "Dirty Diana" from this night's performance, worried that he would offend Princess Diana or the royal family. However, the princess informed Jackson it was her favorite song. In an interview, Jackson stated that he was unable to put the song into the set, which led some fans to believe "Dirty Diana" was not performed on July 16. However, leaked audio snippets prove that the song was re-added to the setlist.In addition to the full July 16 concert, the DVD also includes "The Way You Make Me Feel", from the previous night on July 15 (the song was not performed on July 16 due to a late start of the show) and "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", and "Bad", performed on September 26, 1987, in Yokohama, Japan. The Bad 25 deluxe package also contains a CD of the audio from the July 16 concert as well, with audio edited down to 80 minutes from the original 2 hours.
