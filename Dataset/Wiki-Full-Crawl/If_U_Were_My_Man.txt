"If U Were My Man" is a song by German singersongwriter Sarah Connor from her debut album, Green Eyed Soul (2001). It was the only single not released in Connor's native Germany.
"If U Were My Man" was originally set to be the first single from Green Eyed Soul, but "Let's Get Back to Bed - Boy!" was chosen instead. It was one of the first songs Connor recorded to shop to major labels and created quite a bit of buzz around her.
The song was released as the album's fourth and final single on 8 July 2002, and did not manage to chart noticeably. A promo was made for Polish release though it apparently never occurred. Rumors that "If U Were My Man" would be released in Germany and the rest of Europe were eventually proven false once Connor decided to embark on her first tour instead.
