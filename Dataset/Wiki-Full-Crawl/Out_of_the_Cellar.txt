Out of the Cellar is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Ratt. Released in 1984, it was an immediate success, with wide airplay on radio and heavy rotation on MTV of its singles, especially the decade-defining "Round and Round". The album is certified as triple platinum by the RIAA. The album brought Ratt to the top of the glam metal scene in Los Angeles. Ratt's later work would never surpass the success of Out of the Cellar.According to interviews with Beau Hill that were shot for the film Hair I Go Again, Tom Allom was originally slated to produce the record, before the novice Hill was brought in.
