Francesco Tamagno (28 December 1850  31 August 1905) was an Italian operatic tenor who sang with enormous success throughout Europe and America. On 5 February 1887, he sang Otello in the first performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera. He is also the earliest Italian tenor of note to have left a sizeable body of recordings of his voice. As a man, he was one of the first international public figures to admit (and take quiet pride) in the fact that (from her birth) he was the single parent and carer of a daughter (see below).
