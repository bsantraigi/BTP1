Not to be confused with another Virgin published Doctor Who spin-off under the same title, Twilight of the Gods.

Twilight of the Gods is a novel by Mark Clapham and Jon de Burgh Miller from the Virgin New Adventures with the fictional archaeologist Bernice Summerfield as its main character. The New Adventures were based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Twilight of the Gods was the twenty-third and final New Adventure featuring only Bernice after Virgin lost the licence to publish original Doctor Who fiction.
The novel features the return of the Ferutu, thought destroyed after the events of the Missing Adventure Cold Fusion.
