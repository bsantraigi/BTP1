Reviews on the Run (formerly known as Judgment Day in the United States and "Reviews on the Rock" in the earlier seasons of The Electric Playground)  is a video game review TV show hosted by Victor Lucas and Scott C. Jones (permanently replacing the position vacated by Tommy Tallarico). The show is produced by Lucas' company Greedy Productions. The two hosts rate games independently on a scale of .5 point increments from 0 through 10, with 0 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.
The show has aired in Canada on G4 Canada and City, with pre-2006 episodes airing on G4 in the United States. The show was previously shown in Canada on CTV Two, Space, Razer, and OMNI.1. The show came to an end in 2014, where it reverted into segment on The Electric Playground (now known as EP Daily).
The show is filmed on location at several different locales around Vancouver, British Columbia. Episodes are also occasionally recorded in other cities, such as Tokyo, Japan. A common trademark of the show is to have the hosts stand in frame as video game footage is projected onto an object in the background such as a billboard or the side of a building. The show is filmed over the course of several hours and later edited to fit the show's thirty-minute time frame.
