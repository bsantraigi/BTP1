Come With Me To Hell, Pt. 1 is the second studio album collaboration between Memphis-based rappers DJ Paul and Lord Infamous. It was released in 1994 and distributed through the independent record label, Prophet Entertainment. A "Remastered Edition" of Come With Me To Hell, Pt. 1 was released on March 6, 2014, to critical acclaim, following the success of the re-released material.
The album was produced by DJ Paul and fellow Three 6 Mafia founder Juicy J in its entirety. Many of the songs  such as "Long and Hard" and "Back Against Da Wall"  were later recycled for successive releases from Three 6 Mafia.
