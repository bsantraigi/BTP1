"Welcome to England" is a song by American singer and songwriter Tori Amos, appearing on the album Abnormally Attracted to Sin (2009). It was released as the lead digital single from the studio album on April 14, 2009 by Universal Motown Republic Group, which also marks as her first single released from the label. Written and produced by Amos herself, just like the rest of the album, the song was recorded at her husband's studio in England, Martian Studios.
Musically, the song is a mid-tempo alternative rock song that features a variety of classical music, including influences of britpop, piano rock, baroque pop, ambient music and chamber pop music, along with modern electronica influences. The song's development discusses a woman who has left everything, including her family, friends and lifestyle, to start a new life with her lover. She has cited her husband as her inspiration towards the song, due to her constant move to England. Lyrical themes involve love, departure and family.
Contemporary critics were generally favorable towards the song, who commended the personal subject matter and production. However, some critics felt it lacked originality and didn't live up to expectations. Commercially, the song did not live up to expectations; The song only managed to peak inside the top ten in countries including New Zealand and the United States, where it peaked at four and ten. It did chart in Belgium, but only managed to peak at twenty-four and managed to chart outside the top 100 in Russia. To date, this is Amos' last charting single in any mainstream charts, until her 2012 single "Flavor" was released. An accompanying music video was shot for the single, which featured Amos as two characters; herself and Isabel, a character that was previously featured in her studio album, American Doll Posse. The music video features her walking around iconic landmarks around London, England.
