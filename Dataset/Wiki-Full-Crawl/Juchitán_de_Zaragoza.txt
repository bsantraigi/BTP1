Juchitn de Zaragoza (Spanish pronunciation: [xutitan de saaosa]; Spanish name; Isthmus Zapotec: Xabizende [bznd]) is an indigenous town in the southeast of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is part of the Juchitn District in the west of the Istmo de Tehuantepec region. With a 2005 census population of 74,714 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in the state (just barely behind Salina Cruz). The majority of the indigenous inhabitants are Zapotecs and Huaves. The town also serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The municipality has an area of 414.64 km (160.1 sq mi) and a population of 85,869, the state's third-largest in population.

It is located 26 km northeast of the city of Tehuantepec.  Its Palacio Municipal dates back to the middle of the 19th century and perhaps is the widest "palace" in Mexico with 31 arches in its front portal. Its main church is the Parroquia de San Vicente Ferrer (Parish of San Vicente Ferrer) which dates from the 17th century.  To the west of the Palacio is a large market where local products can be seen and a local variant of the Zapotec language can be heard.Juchitn was the first Mexican town to elect a left wing pro-socialist municipal government in the 20th century, when Leopoldo de Gyves won the elections for mayor in 1980 against the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). The region's progressive politics and strong work ethic have cultivated a tradition of powerful women and an unusual tolerance for alternative gender roles. An article in Elle magazine called Juchitn "The Last Matriarchy". Many Juchitecas were angry about the article, saying it distorted what life is really like in Juchitn. Groups of women demanded that a local storekeeper stop selling the magazine issue.
