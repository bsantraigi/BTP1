Psittirostrini is one of three tribes belonging to the Hawaiian honeycreepers. It is made up of the thick-billed birds, colloquially known as the Hawaiian finches, that once inhabited all of the Hawaiian Islands. These birds are granivorous and have songs like those of cardueline finches.  Extant species include the Laysan finch, the Nihoa finch, the Maui parrotbill, and the palila, which may possibly be the last remaining species left alive in this group. Extinct species include the four koa finches, the , and the Lnai hookbill.
