The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome is the eleventh studio album by the British rock group Slade. It was released on 3 December 1983 and reached No. 49 in the UK charts. The album was produced largely by bassist Jim Lea. The two UK Top 10 singles released from the album, "My Oh My" and "Run Runaway", were produced by John Punter.
In 1984, the album was re-packaged and released as Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply in the United States and Canada. Both "Run Runaway" and "My Oh My" were US Top 40 hits that year, giving the band their long-awaited breakthrough there.
