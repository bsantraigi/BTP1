Rovo is a Japanese instrumental band founded in 1996 in Tokyo by former Boredoms guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto, Bondage Fruit electric violinist Yuji Katsui, and synthesizer/effects technician Tatsuki Masuko, and featuring Yasuhiro Yoshigaki on drums and percussion, Youichi Okabe on drums and percussion, and Jin Harada on bass guitar.  Rovo defines their music as "man-drive trance," and many of their compositions have a repetitive minimalism, blended with progressive rock and psychedelic music, in the style of 1970s band Gong. They collaborated with Gong guitarist Steve Hillage's group System 7 on the 2013 album "Phoenix Rising".
