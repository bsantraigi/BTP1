Narrabri  is a town and seat of Narrabri Shire local government area in the North West Slopes, New South Wales, Australia on the Namoi River, 521 kilometres (324 mi) northwest of Sydney. It sits on the junction of the Kamilaroi Highway and the Newell Highway. At the 2016 census, the town of Narrabri had a population of 5,903.As a result of the geography of Narrabri and the surrounding areas, Narrabri township was quite prone to flooding and fire. Recently, changes have been made to the river flow to improve overall safety. 
It is the centre of a major cotton-growing industry. Other agricultural industries in the area include wheat, beef and lamb.  Nearby attractions are Mount Kaputar National Park, the Australia Telescope Compact Array at the Paul Wild Observatory (administered by the CSIRO) and a number of agricultural centres. Just to the south of town is the Pilliga Forest, the largest remnant temperate forest in Eastern Australia. This will be where the Narrabri Coal Seam Gas Project is going to be located and west along from Narrabri to Yarrie Lake, which will be surrounded by 450 gas well pads with 850 gas wells over the next 20 years if the project goes ahead. Narrabri also has The Crossing Theatre, a 1,000-seat auditorium and cinema complex.
