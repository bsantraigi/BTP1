Thy Kingdom Come is the fifth studio album by West Coast hip hop artist King T. It was released in 2002 on Greedy Green Entertainment and Mo Beatz. The album was originally titled The Kingdom Come and was slated for a release on June 30, 1998, on Aftermath Entertainment. The 2002 release contains all of the same tracks as the 1998 version, except 2 tracks. The 1998 version was to be King Tee's first release of new material in three years after allying with Dr. Dre and appearing on his compilation, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath. King Tee's album was later put on hold. His shelved album had already been rated three and a half stars out of five by The Source, which was "not good enough" for Dr. Dre, but King Tee maintained a positive relationship with Dr. Dre. He even appeared on Dr. Dre's album, 2001, in 1999. By 2002, The Kingdom Come was released to mixed opinions and was a commercial failure. It had no charting singles, and it did not chart as an album. The album has been released in some places under the original name "Thy Kingdom Come" with an alternative album cover. The song "Speak On It" also appeared on San Andreas: The Original Mixtape, an album by King T's protg Young Maylay.
