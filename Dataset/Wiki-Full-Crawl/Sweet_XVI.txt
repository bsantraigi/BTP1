Sweet XVI is the second EP by American recording artist Ma. Her second EP, it was released on April 21, 2014 worldwide via digital media store iTunes, marking Harrison's fifth independently released project through her own label imprint Planet 9 via INgrooves. The six-track EP commemorates the release of her debut studio album Ma (1998) and 16th anniversary in the entertainment industry. Its release was preceded by its first and only single, the Eric Bellinger-assisted "Same Page".Described as "more up-tempo" than its predecessor, the EP With Love, Sweet XVI is intended to celebrate not only Harrison's journey thus far, but be an indication of a new path as she reinvents her career and gears up to tour and work on her ninth studio project. Production on Sweet XVI was primarily handled by longtime friend and frequent collaborator Yonni with additional contributions from musicians Antione Hart and Nate "Impact" Jolley as well as her in-house team of producers The Alliance. Just as Harrison did on previous projects, she used existing material she personally pulled from her archive of unreleased music.
