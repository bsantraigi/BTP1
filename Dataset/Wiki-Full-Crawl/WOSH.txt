WOSH (branded as NewsTalk 1490) is a radio station serving the Oshkosh, Wisconsin area with a News/Talk format from the ABC News Radio network. This station broadcasts on AM frequency 1490 kHz and is under ownership of Cumulus Media. During the late 1960s until 1975, WOSH was the leading Top 40 radio station in the Appleton-Oshkosh market; in the summer of 1975, WOSH's Top 40 format was moved to its sister FM operation at 103.9, with Jonathon Brandmeier as the station's star disc jockey, and WOSH-FM's Country and Western music format was placed on 1490 AM, with the new call sign WYTL applied. In 1984, the call sign WOSH was reinstated to 1490 and the current news/talk format established. WOSH also broadcast a UHF TV signal under WOSH-TV 48 for a time.
