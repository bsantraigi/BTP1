Starring Paola Volpato and Alvaro Rudolphy, and directed by Patricio Gonzalez, Pablo Aedo, Felipe Arratia, and Mauricio Lucero, Pituca sin lucas was filmed by Chilefilms studios. It was considered the most watched Chilean telenovela since 2006, reaching an average audience rating of 25.3 points and over 50% of the total share of Chilean television.It was considered an unprecedented success for Mega in the genre of fiction (usually dominated by Canal 13 and TVN). Pituca sin lucas is about a wealthy woman who, after being abandoned by her husband, must adjust to a new economic reality. She decides to live in a middle-class neighborhood where she finds love and emotional stability with a widower that works in a fish and seafood market. The story is set between La Dehesa, one of the highest income neighboods of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, and Maip, a middle class commune of the same region.
Of the several subplots that involve teenagers and antagonists throughout the show, the portrayal of Lita by actress Gabriela Hernandez was what caught the attention of television and internet audiences. Her high-class vocabulary and her way with people gained considerable acclaim. The soundtrack for the show is the song Cuando nos volvamos a encontrar (When We Find Each Other Again) by Colombian artist Carlos Vives, played during the opening sequence and final credits.
