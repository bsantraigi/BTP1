Montreal Supra was a club in the Canadian Soccer League from 1988 to 1992. They were Montreal's first professional soccer team, since the NASL's Montreal Manic folded in 1983. Many of the Montreal Supra's best players would join the American Professional Soccer League after the clubs and leagues' demise after the 1992 CSL's season, playing for the expansion Montreal Impact, winning the league championship in 1994, during the team's second season.
