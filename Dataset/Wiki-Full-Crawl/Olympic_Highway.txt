The Olympic Highway is a rural road in the central western and south-eastern Riverina regions of New South Wales, Australia. The 318-kilometre (198 mi) highway services rural communities and links the Hume Highway with the Mid-Western Highway and provides part of an alternate road link between Sydney and Albury via Bathurst and Cowra as well as servicing Wagga Wagga, linking with the Sturt Highway.Initially a series of trunk routes, the road was named the Olympic Way on 5 July 1963, in honour of part of the path that the Olympic Torch took on its journey from Cowra to Albury for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. It was renamed as the Olympic Highway in 1996, and the route between Wagga Wagga and Cowra was used for torch relay for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. In spite of its name, the road is not an official highway as classified by NSW Roads & Maritime Services, yet considered a rural road.The Olympic Highway carries the A41 shield for its entire length, the majority of which is a single carriageway and also includes wider sections within urban areas and some passing lanes. Where the road passes through suburban areas it accommodates both parking and pedestrian needs of the town shopping centre and highway through traffic. A 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) section of the highway through Wagga Wagga is a four-lane divided urban road where the highway is concurrent with the Sturt Highway.
