Lay It Down is the sixth studio album by the Canadian alt-country band Cowboy Junkies. Released on February 27, 1996, it was the group's first album for Geffen Records after the end of their contract with RCA Records. It was the band's first album that could be described as straight-ahead rock, rather than country rock, country or blues. It was also their first album consisting entirely of original material, with no covers. "A Common Disaster" and "Speaking Confidentially" were notable hits for the band on Canadian radio.
The album also includes two versions of the track "Come Calling", which is presented in male and female versions representing two sides of a relationship of an elderly couple, dealing with the pain and anguish of Alzheimer's disease. The "Angel Mine" music video, featuring Janeane Garofalo, was filmed at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The song "Hold on to Me" was used in the soundtrack of the 1998 film Homegrown.
