Havov (Czech pronunciation: [avirof] (listen); Polish: Hawierzw, Cieszyn Silesian: Hawiyrzw) is a city in the Karvin District, Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has 77,449  inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the region. It is the largest town in the country without a university. Havov lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.
Havov was founded after World War II (thus being the youngest city in today's Czech Republic) as a coal mining town. Havov officially became a town in 1955. It was built on top of several villages with significant Polish populations. The local people were given apartments in the newly built city, and most of their old houses were demolished to make room for new urban buildings. The majority of the population of Havov emigrated from other parts of Czechoslovakia, many of them from Slovakia, as migrant workers, thus substantially altering the ethnic structure of the area. Today, the original villages are administratively part of the city and mostly lie on the outskirts of urban Havov. It was to have been named estprcov, but it was deemed not the best name for the city, so it was named Havov.
