To All New Arrivals is the 5th studio album by dance music act Faithless. The album was created after the positive response to the Faithless Greatest Hits tour, originally described as their "final tour".  The album was released on 27 November 2006, a week after the single Bombs. The title for the album was inspired by the recent birth of two babies to band members Rollo and Sister Bliss. Lead singer Maxi Jazz loved the title, partly due to his Buddhist faith and partly due to his parents being new arrivals to the UK in the 1950s.The tagline for the album are lyrics taken from the song "Music Matters":

For all those who stood up and were counted,
For all those for whom money was no motive,
For all those for whom music was a message,
I want to thank you.

In one notable collaboration, the track "Spiders, Crocodiles & Kryptonite" features the vocals of Robert Smith of post-punk group The Cure. The song also contains samples and a section of arrangement from The Cure hit "Lullaby". 
The album was supported by a tour of all of the United Kingdom's major arenas which began in Nottingham on 17 March 2007. It entered the UK album chart at #30 for the week ending 3 December 2006. Given that their previous studio album, No Roots, entered the charts at #1, this position was seen as a disappointment.
Unlike the original versions of Faithless' previous studio albums, initially this album was not released in the United States.  However, a "Deluxe Version" appeared on the U.S. iTunes Store on 4 November 2007.
The album cover features the 1880 oil painting, Nightfall on the Thames, by John Atkinson Grimshaw.
