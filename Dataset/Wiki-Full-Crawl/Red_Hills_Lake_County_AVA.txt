The Red Hills Lake County AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Lake County, California.  The wine region lies along the southwestern shores of Clear Lake, separating Excelsior Valley to the east from Big Valley to the west.  The hills lie at the foot of Mount Konocti, a volcano which last erupted 11,000 years ago, but which is still regarded as active.  The terrain is rolling hills with elevations between 1,400 feet (430 m) and 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level.  The Red Hills receive an average of 25 inches (64 cm) to 40 inches (102 cm) in rainfall each year.
