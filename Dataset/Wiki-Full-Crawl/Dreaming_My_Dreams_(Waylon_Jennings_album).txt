Dreaming My Dreams is  the twenty-second studio album by country music singer Waylon Jennings. The album was co-produced with Jack Clement and  recorded at Glaser Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, between February and July 1974.
Following the 1972 renewal of his contract with RCA Records, Jennings gained artistic freedom, started to produce his own records, and changed his image to one inspired by the ongoing outlaw movement. Jennings recorded the critically acclaimed Honky Tonk Heroes and the commercial success This Time.
Jennings left the recording studios of RCA and moved his operation to the Glaser Sound Studio. After producer Clement married Jennings' sister-in-law and they became acquainted, Jennings was inspired to record an album upon hearing Allen Reynolds singing "Dreaming My Dreams with You" during a demo session hosted by Clement. Upon its release, the album received highly positive reviews from publications such as Rolling Stone, with critics praising the choice of songs and Jennings' vocals.
Dreaming My Dreams was released in June 1975; it topped the country albums chart and peaked at number forty-nine on the Billboard's Top LPs & Tapes. It was certified gold by the RIAA and Jennings won the Male Vocalist of the Year Country Music Association award. The singles "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" and "Dreaming My Dreams with You" peaked at numbers one and ten respectively on Billboard's Hot Country Songs.
