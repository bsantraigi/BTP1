Tudo Ao Mesmo Tempo Agora (Everything at the Same Time Now) is the sixth album by Brazilian rock band Tits, and the last one to feature vocalist Arnaldo Antunes. It marks another shift in the band's style, who returned to a more rock-oriented sound with aggressive, sometimes even scatological lyrics, such as in "Isso Para Mim  Perfume".
