A brothel or bordello is a place where people engage in sexual activity with prostitutes, who are sometimes referred to as sex workers. Technically, any premises where prostitution commonly takes place qualifies as a brothel.  However, for legal or cultural reasons, establishments often describe themselves as massage parlors, bars, strip clubs, body rub parlours, studios, or by some other description. Sex work in a brothel is considered safer than street prostitution.
