Wangen an der Aare is a municipality in the Oberaargau administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
This small town lies between Olten and Solothurn in rural surroundings on the Aare, a major river of the west-central lowland region of Switzerland, the Mittelland. An ancient wooden covered bridge crosses the Aare at this point. Wangen an der Aare was the administrative centre of the former district of the same name.
