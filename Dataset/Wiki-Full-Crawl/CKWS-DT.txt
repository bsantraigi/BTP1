From 1954 through 2015, CKWS was an affiliate of CBC Television. CBC chose to end its affiliations with Corus' privately owned affiliates effective August 30, 2015. Beginning the following day, CKWS began carrying programs from the CTV Television Network.
On August 14, 2018, it was announced that CKWS' affiliation agreement with CTV would expire on August 27; the station subsequently became a Global owned-and-operated station, rebranding itself as Global Kingston.
