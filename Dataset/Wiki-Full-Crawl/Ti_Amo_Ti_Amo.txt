"Ti Amo Ti Amo" is the tenth single released by the Italian singer Alexia released in 2000 and was the only new track from her first best of compilation album The Hits. It was the last single she released that was produced by Robyx as she decided to leave the DWA team so that she could grow as an artist and pursue different styles of music.When the single was announced, there was some confusion in that it was initially thought the single was "Te Amo", a track from Alexia's then current album Happy which had been a fan favourite. Fan opinion on the single was divided, with some fans labelling it "unacceptable".
