"Bigger Than My Body" is the first single released by John Mayer from his second album Heavier Things. As a B-side, the single contained a cover of Radiohead's "Kid A" and an original song that was not included on Heavier Things, "Tracing". The intro to the song was generated using an Adrenalinn effects processor developed by Roger Linn.
