Kasserine Governorate (Arabic:   Wilyat al-Garn pronounced [asrin]), sometimes spelt Casrein, is one of the twenty-four governorates (provinces) of Tunisia. It is in west-central Tunisia on the frontier with Algeria, wholly north of the true centre line but the area is south or west of the bulk of the population of the country, based on Tunisia's greater northern rainfall. It covers an area of 8,260 km and has a population of 439,243 (2014 census). The capital is Kasserine which is at the foot of Jebel ech Chambi, Tunisia's highest mountain, in turn part of the Dorsal Atlas mountains.  The mountain and its associated escarpment form its own national park in the province.
