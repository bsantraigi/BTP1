The Woodwright's Shop is a traditional woodworking show hosted by master carpenter Roy Underhill on PBS in the United States. It is one of the longest running "how to" shows on PBS, with thirty-five 13-episode seasons filmed. Since its debut in 1979, the show has aired over 400 episodes. The first two seasons were broadcast only on public TV in North Carolina; the season numbering was restarted when the show went national in 1981. It is still filmed at the UNC-TV (University of North Carolina Center for Public Television) studios in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
