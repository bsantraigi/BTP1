The Yari Film Group (YFG) is an independent film company founded in 2002, and headed by producer Bob Yari, which deals in financing, production, acquisition, sales and distribution of theatrical feature films.  Yari Film Group has been under fire for over a decade for breach of contract and failure to pay other producers and actors such as Sharon Stone.  Bob Yari has been a defendant in numerous lawsuits and judgments have been upheld by the courts.
The company's early production credits included Academy Award Winner Crash, with a cast led by Matt Dillon and Sandra Bullock; The Hoax, with Richard Gere; The Matador with Pierce Brosnan; The Painted Veil starring Edward Norton; A Love Song for Bobby Long with John Travolta; Dave Chappelle's Block Party; Prime with Meryl Streep; and Thumbsucker with a cast including Keanu Reeves and Vince Vaughn.
In December 2008, Yari filed for bankruptcy. They continue to operate while under creditor protection as of March 2009.
