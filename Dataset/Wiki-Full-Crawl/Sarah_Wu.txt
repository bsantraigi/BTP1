Sarah Wu (born 1977) is an American elementary school teacher who went undercover in 2010 to "raise awareness about school lunch food in America." Throughout 2010, Wu ate school-lunch every day and anonymously documented the food being served via her blog at Fedupwithlunch.com. During the project, Wu was a teacher in the Chicago public school system and worked at Haugan Elementary.
