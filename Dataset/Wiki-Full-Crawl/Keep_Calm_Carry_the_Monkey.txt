Keep Calm and Carry the Monkey is the second album by Australian rock band Skipping Girl Vinegar.
The first single from the album, "One Long Week", was released in March 2011. This heralded a harder and more dynamic sound. The song was playlisted by Triple J and other Australian radio stations. The album was released two months later.
Skipping Girl Vinegar opened the 2011 Splendour in the Grass festival. Days after the festival the band released another single, "Wasted".

In March 2012, the band performed on the Australian television programme Adam Hills' In Gordon Street Tonight with their single "Chase the Sun".
