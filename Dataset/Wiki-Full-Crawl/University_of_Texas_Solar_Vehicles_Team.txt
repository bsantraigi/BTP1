The University of Texas Solar Vehicles Team (UTSVT) is a student-driven effort to design, build, test, and race solar vehicles for the purpose of reinforcing skills learned in the classroom, raising awareness of solar power, and bringing solar power closer to practicality. To accomplish this task, a multidisciplinary group consisting of students from various engineering disciplines, and students from all across UT, such as the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Natural Sciences come together to design and construct the most efficient vehicle as possible.
The vehicles are completely powered by the sun and are entered in competitions against universities from across the U.S. and Internationally. In addition to participating in races, the team participates in outreach events to educate the general public and K-12 students about the excitement of STEM careers and alternative energy.
