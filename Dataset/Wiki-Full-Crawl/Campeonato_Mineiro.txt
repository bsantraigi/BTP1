Campeonato Mineiro is the state football league of the state of Minas Gerais and is controlled by the Minas Gerais Football Federation FMF (Federao Mineira de Futebol).
The history of Campeonato Mineiro can be divided into two parts: before and after the construction of the Mineiro, in September 1966. The Mineiro is the biggest football stadium of Minas Gerais and it is located in Minas Gerais' state capital, Belo Horizonte. Before the stadium's inauguration Amrica and Atltico were the most successful teams in the state, but after the construction of the Mineiro, known as the "Era Mineiro" ("Mineiro Era"), another team from the capital, Cruzeiro, also gained prominence. Atltico is the most successful team in the competition, having won 44 championships as of 2017, while Cruzeiro has dominated the "Mineiro Era" with 24 championships.
As with many other Brazilian football state leagues, the Campeonato Mineiro is much older than the Brazilian League itself. This is partly because in the early 20th century Brazil did not have a well established transportation and communication infrastructure, that could help it organize a national league in the country, which was made worse by the nation's enormous size.
Many of the best players in Brazilian football were first seen in the Campeonato Mineiro, players like Reinaldo, Cerezo, der, Ronaldo, Dario and Tosto had their professional football debut in the competition.
