Dr. Dre Presents... the Aftermath is a compilation album produced by Dr. Dre, featuring various artists. The album was released on November 26, 1996, a week after the release of the lead single, "East Coast / West Coast Killas" featuring Group Therapy. The album is Dre's first release after leaving Death Row Records, and was the first release on his then newly established Aftermath Entertainment. In spite of Dr. Dre's name being on the album, and it being certified platinum, it received mixed reviews and was not amongst the year's more commercially successful releases. The album was later followed by the second single, the Dr. Dre solo track "Been There, Done That".
Dr. Dre later said: "That point of my life, musically, it was just off balance. I was off track then and trying to find it. It was a period of doubt It happens with artists. Everything isnt going to be out of the park"
