Guymon is a city in and the county seat of Texas County, Oklahoma.  As of the 2010 census, the city population was 11,442, an increase of 6.5 percent from 10,472 in 2000.  Cattle feedlots, corporate pork farms, and natural gas dominate its economy, with wind energy production and transmission recently diversifying landowners' farms.
Guymon promotes itself with the slogan, "Queen City of the Panhandle." Some cynics apparently have coined another slogan, "Home of the Most Lied-About Weather in the U.S."
