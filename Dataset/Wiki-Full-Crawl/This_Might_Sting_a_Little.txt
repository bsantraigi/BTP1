This Might Sting a Little was the second album by Christian metal group Disciple, released in 1999. The album contained a bonus disc for the buyer to "give the CD to someone that is not saved!". This album was remastered and re-released in 2004. This is the only Disciple album to contain no Ballads of any form.
