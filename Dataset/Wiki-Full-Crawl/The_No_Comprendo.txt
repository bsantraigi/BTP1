The No Comprendo (Long title: Les Rita Mitsouko Prsentent The No Comprendo) is the second studio album by French pop rock group Les Rita Mitsouko. It was released in 1986 and includes the singles "Andy", "C'est Comme a" and "Les Histoires dA.".
The album was recorded with veteran producer Tony Visconti at Studio Good Earth, London, Studio Rita Mitsouko, Paris and mixed at Studio Good Earth. Receiving positive reviews the album was originally released as an LP, Cassette and CD in September 1986. CD editions include a bonus track. The artwork was designed by Yves Mry with photography by Brett Walker.
The album was the first of two albums by the duo that Les Rita Mitsouko produced on collaboration with Tony Visconti. Together with Visconti the trio shared production and musician roles regularly swapping and sharing duties across a variety of instruments.
Prior to the album the group was simply called Rita Mitsouko. In the interim between the dbut and 1986's The No Comprendo, Catherine Ringer and Fred Chichin amended their name adding 'Les' to 'Rita Mitsouko'. The decision was made to negate the possibility that audiences would identify the name as referring to Catherine Ringer only as opposed to a musical group.
