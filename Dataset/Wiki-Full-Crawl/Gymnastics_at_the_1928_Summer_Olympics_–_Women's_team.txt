The women's team event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1928 Summer Olympics. It was the first Olympic gymnastics event for women, and was the only gymnastics event for women that year.  Women's gymnastics would not return again until 1936.  Total scores were determined by adding drill, apparatus, and vault components.
