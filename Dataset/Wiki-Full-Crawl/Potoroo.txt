A potoroo is a kangaroo-like marsupial about the size of a rabbit. It is a macropod. All three extant species are threatened, especially the long-footed potoroo (Endangered) and Gilbert's potoroo (Critically Endangered). The main threats are predation by introduced species (especially foxes) and habitat loss.
Potoroos were formerly very common in Australia, and early settlers reported them as being significant pests to their crops.
Gilbert's Potoroo was discovered in 1840 by a naturalist called John Gilbert. It was then thought to have become extinct until being rediscovered in 1994 at the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve (near Albany) in Western Australia. Conservation efforts have grown an initial wild population of 30-40 to over 100.
