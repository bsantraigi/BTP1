The CMLL 79th Anniversary Show was a professional wrestling event produced by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) that took place on September 14, 2012 in CMLL's home arena Arena Mxico in Mexico City, Mexico. The event commemorated the 79th anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion in the world. The Anniversary show is normally CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The 79th Anniversary show was also billed as Juicio Final, or "Final Justice"/"Doomsday", a title that CMLL has used at times either as a tag line for the tag line for an Anniversary show or as the name of a separate super show produced by CMLL marketed as CMLL Juicio Final. The show replaced CMLL's regular Friday night Super Viernes ("Super Friday") shows and was taped for later broadcast.
The main event of the show was a Lucha de Apuestas, or "bet match", where both El Terrible and Rush put their hair on the line, with the loser being shaved completely bald after the match. The show also featured an additional Lucha de Apuestas match on the under card, this time with Puma King and Rey Cometa both putting their wrestling mask on the line, with the loser being forced to unmask afterwards and reveal his birth name per lucha libre traditions. The show featured an additional four matches, all contested under Best two-out-of three-falls six-man tag team rules, the most prevalent match format in CMLL and most Mexican wrestling shows.
