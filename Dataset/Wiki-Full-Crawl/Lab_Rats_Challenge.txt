Lab Rats Challenge is an Australian children's game show. The program began broadcasting on 4 August 2008 at 4pm on the Nine Network with hosts Drew Jarvis and Nicole Dixon. On 5 March 2012, the show moved to the Seven Network with Aleisha Rose replacing Dixon for the revived series. On 12 February 2013 at 10:15am, the show moved to ABC3 (now known as 'ABC ME'). The show has also been broadcast on Cartoon Network.
In contrast to other Australian children's game shows such as Sharky's Friends, A*mazing, and Go Go Stop, which are filmed on a large set in front of a live studio audience, Lab Rats Challenge uses several smaller sets resembling an abandoned science laboratory as well as special effects sequences inserted in post-production. It is filmed in Brisbane's Channel 9 studio on Mount Coot-tha, Queensland.
