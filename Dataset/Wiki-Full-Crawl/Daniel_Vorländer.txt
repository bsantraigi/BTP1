Daniel Vorlnder (11 June 1867  8 June 1941) was a German chemist who synthesized most of the liquid crystals known until his retirement in 1935. 
Vorlnder was born in Eupen in Rhenish Prussia. He studied chemistry at Kiel, Munich, and Berlin, after which he became a professor at University of Halle-Wittenberg.
Vorlnder applied his knowledge of molecular structure to select those exhibiting the crystaline liquid state. In particular a linear molecular geometry was conducive. "Over the years Vorlnder and his students synthesized hundreds of liquid crystaline compounds. An interesting discovery was that amongst the slimy liquid crystals were many soap and soap-like compounds." (Dunmur & Sluckin p 48)
Vorlnder served as a volunteer during World War I, during which he received the Iron Cross. He died in Halle.
