"Pass the Mic" is the first single from the third studio album Check Your Head by Beastie Boys, released on April 7, 1992.
The last track on the single, "Netty's Girl", has a short clip stitched on the end of it, as well as a secret 3 second clip at the end of the track. The actual song is only 3 minutes long, as it appears on the compilation The Sounds of Science.
The song was the subject of the landmark Newton v. Diamond case, in which the band was found not liable for infringement of copyright on the underlying composition of a three-note, six-second sampled recording of James Newton's "Choir". The band had paid Newton's record label for the use of the sound recording in 1992. The court found that they were not obligated to also license the underlying composition, as three notes qualifies as de minimis use.
