Into the Pandemonium is the third studio album by Swiss extreme metal band Celtic Frost, released in 1987. The album is more varied than Celtic Frost's past LPs, with unlikely covers (Wall of Voodoo's "Mexican Radio"), emotionally charged love songs, the album's recurring industrial-influenced rhythmic songs of demons and destruction, traditional Frost-styled songs about dreams and fear, and a dark, classical piece with female vocals.
The album is vastly different from the band's previous work which cemented its late 1980s avant-garde metal term; it is also a departure from the style found on the band's previous albums, Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion that Celtic Frost had become known for. However, it does have the recurring symphonic elements found on previous albums. The album has a more classic heavy metal style within the songs with elements of industrial, classical, gothic rock and doom metal. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic called it "one of the classic extreme metal albums of all time."The track "Rex Irae" is the opening part of Celtic Frost's requiem; the third, concluding part of which, "Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale)" can be heard on 2006's Monotheist. The second part of the requiem has never released by the band, however Fischer has confirmed he will be performing the long missing second part at Roadburn 2019 with Triptykon along with a live orchestra. 
"Inner Sanctum" was featured in the 2009 video game Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned.
