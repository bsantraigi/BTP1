The Fiat Stilo (Type 192) is a small family car available as a three door and a five door hatchback, as well as an estate (Fiat Stilo MultiWagon), produced by the Italian automaker Fiat. The Stilo three door and five door were launched in November 2001, at the Bologna Motor Show, to replace the Fiat Bravo/Brava, with the Stilo MultiWagon following in January 2003. 
The Fiat Bravo was the successor of the Stilo in most markets, however, the five door Stilo continued to be manufactured in Brazil until December 2010, when it was replaced by the Bravo. The Stilo came in third place in the European Car of the Year awards for 2002, behind the Peugeot 307 and Renault Laguna.
