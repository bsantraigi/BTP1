The Central Maluku languages are a putative group of fifty Austronesian languages (geographically CentralEastern Malayo-Polynesian languages) spoken principally on the Seram, Buru, Ambon, Kei, and the Sula Islands. None of the languages have as many as fifty thousand speakers, and several are extinct.
