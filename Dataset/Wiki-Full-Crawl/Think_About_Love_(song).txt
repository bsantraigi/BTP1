"Think About Love" is a song recorded by Dolly Parton, first released on her 1985 Real Love album.  The song, written by Richard "Spady" Brannan and Tom Campbell, was an uptempo pop tune, employing (as did most of the other songs on Real Love) synthesizers and other distinctive pop flourishes.  It was released as the album's third single in November 1985 and, despite its polished pop production, reached #1 on the U.S. country singles charts in March 1986; the single spent a total of fourteen weeks on the chart.  The song was Parton's sixteenth number one country single as a solo artist.The song was remixed for its single version. The remixed version of the song also served as the title track on Parton's 1986 Think About Love album, which was composed of previously released tracks, many of which had been remixed.  The single mix (the version played on the radio and available on 45) has never been released on any CD in the US or abroad. It was Parton's last chart-topper on RCA, her label of the previous nineteen years. (She would switch to Columbia Records in 1987).
