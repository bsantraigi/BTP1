Copperhill is a city in Polk County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 354 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area.
For years, up until the 1980s, the production of copper and acid denuded the area of any greenery, although the area has now been greatly reforested, due to a multimillion-dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company.  The copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas.  Much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to China.  Glenn Springs Holdings has cleaned and purified all the surrounding creeks and waterways, and water quality is now back to near pristine condition according to published EPA and Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation studies (source needed).
The town is now a tourist attraction, with near daily rail excursions from Blue Ridge, Georgia, on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railroad, and near daily rail excursions from The Gee Creek Wilderness on the Hiwassee River Railroad.  Whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River also attracts many people and other outdoor activities such as Mountain Biking and Hiking are also popular in the area. The area was the host for the whitewater portion of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
