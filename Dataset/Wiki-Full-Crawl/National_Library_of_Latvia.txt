The National Library of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Nacionl bibliotka) also known as Castle of Light (Gaismas pils) is a national cultural institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture of Latvia. The National Library of Latvia was formed in 1919 after the independent Republic of Latvia was proclaimed in 1918. The first supervisor of the Library was Jnis Misi, a librarian and the founder of the Latvian scientific bibliography (18621945).
Today the Library plays an important role in the development of Latvia's information society, providing Internet access to residents and supporting research and lifelong education.
