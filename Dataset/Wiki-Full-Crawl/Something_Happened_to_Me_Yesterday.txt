"Something Happened to Me Yesterday" is the closing track of The Rolling Stones' 1967 album Between the Buttons.
Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and recorded in August and November 1966, "Something Happened to Me Yesterday" is the first officially released Rolling Stones track to feature Richards on separate lead vocal. Jagger sings the verses; Richards sings the chorus and plays the electric and acoustic guitars; Charlie Watts is on drums and Bill Wyman on bass, Brian Jones whistles and plays saxophone, Jack Nitzsche plays piano, and the Mike Leander Orchestra performs the brass section.
At the time of the song's release, Jagger said: "I leave it to the individual imagination as to what happened." Matthew Greenwald calls it "one [of] the most accurate songs about LSD."The song ends with a spoken passage: "Well thank you very much and now I think it's time for us all to go. So from all of us to all of you, not forgetting the boys in the band and our producer Reg Thorpe, we'd like to say God bless. So if you're out tonight, don't forget, if you're on your bike, wear white. Evening all." Jagger has said (plainly facetiously) that this passage is "something I remember hearing on the BBC as the bombs dropped", (i.e. in the first two years of his life). However, this sort of homily was typically rendered at the end of an episode of the early police procedural Dixon of Dock Green by PC Dixon, an old school bobby.
