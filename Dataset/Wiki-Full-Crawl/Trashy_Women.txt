"Trashy Women" is a song written by Chris Wall and recorded by country music singer Jerry Jeff Walker in 1989 and later by the band Confederate Railroad. It reached number 63 on the US Country chart in 1989 for Walker, and was a number 10 country hit four years later from Confederate Railroad's self-titled debut album.
According to legend, Walker was in the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar in Jackson, WY one evening and heard either Wall (who was also a bartender at the bar) or Kip Attaway performing the song.  He then asked whichever it was to come to his hotel room later to teach him the song.
