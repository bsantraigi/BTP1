"8th World Wonder" is the 2004 debut single from American Idol finalist Kimberley Locke, from the album One Love. The single (written by Canadian songwriter/performer Joel Parkes, Shaun Shankel & Kyle Jacobs) debuted on the Billboard Singles Sales Chart at number one, making it the first non-Idol single to top the chart from any Idol finalist. The single was later nominated in the category for "Best Love Song" at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards. The release also features a brand new modern arrangement of Locke's signature song from the show, "Somewhere Over the Rainbow".
"8th World Wonder" is one of the longest-running Idol singles to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 20 weeks on the chart and peaking at number 49. Outside the United States, the song only managed to chart in the United Kingdom, also reaching number 49. In a recent Entertainment Weekly magazine, "8th World Wonder" was listed as one of the top 5 songs to come out of American Idol.
