Adult Swim Brain Trust (also known as Anime Talk Show) is an animated television special that aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, on November 4, 2004. The special revolves around the unofficial pilot for Squidbillies. It is often considered the very last episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast since it follows the same format as the show, with Space Ghost interviewing guests. The short was dubbed "Anime Talk Show" due to it following the premiere of Perfect Hair Forever, which aired in place of what was supposed to have been the premiere of Squidbillies. It was given the official name Adult Swim Brain Trust when it was uploaded to YouTube and the Adult Swim website in 2012.
Adult Swim Brain Trust was released as a special feature on the Squidbillies Volume One DVD on October 16, 2007. The special is also available on Adult Swim's YouTube channel.
