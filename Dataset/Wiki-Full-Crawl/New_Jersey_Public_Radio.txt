New Jersey Public Radio (NJPR) is an NPR member network serving portions of northern New Jersey. It is owned by New York Public Radio (NYPR), which also owns WNYC-AM-FM in New York City, and WQXR-FM in Newark and its simulcaster WQXW in Ossining, New York. The network comprises the four northernmost radio stations of the former New Jersey Network (NJN).  It primarily serves northern New Jersey residents who are unable to get a clear signal from the WNYC stations.
The network went on the air on July 1, 2011, after NJN ended operations the day before.
