The Ferrari Mondial is a mid-engined, V8-powered grand tourer which was produced by Italian manufacturer Ferrari between 1980 and 1993. Offered with coup and cabriolet bodystyles, it replaced the Ferrari 308/208 GT4 coup and remains the last V8, rear mid-engined, 2+2 model Ferrari produced.   
The Mondial name (French for world or global) originated from Ferrari's motor racing history  the 500 Mondial was a successful lightweight sports racer of the early 1950s which was named to celebrate Ferrari's consecutive Formula 1 World Championships in 1952 and 1953. The name was revived as Ferrari won the Formula 1 World Constructors Championships in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. The Mondial name was also chosen as it was an equivoque, the car designed to meet global safety and emission standards for 1980, compared to previous offerings.  Conceived as a 'practical' Ferrari, the Mondial is a genuine long-distance four-seater, with sufficient rear head- and leg-room for children and smaller adults. It affords easy access via the long single doors, and has surprisingly good all-round visibility for a mid-engined car. The vehicle has a slightly higher roofline and greater all-round dimensions compared to its two-seater stable mates, resulting in a comparative weight penalty of around ten percent.The Mondial cabriolets are the only production vehicles manufactured to a four-seater, rear mid-engined, full-convertible design.
