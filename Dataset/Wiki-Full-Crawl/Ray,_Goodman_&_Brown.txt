Ray, Goodman & Brown is an American R&B vocal group. The group originated as The Moments, who formed in the mid-1960s and whose greatest successes came in the 1970s with hits including "Love on a Two-Way Street", "Sexy Mama" and "Look at Me (I'm in Love)".  In 1979, for contractual reasons they changed their name to Ray, Goodman & Brown and had further hits, including "Special Lady".
