In 2012 Matthew Carter wrote about the film: "This film is about patient and dedicated teaching, about learning to look and visualize in order to design, about the importance of drawing. It is one designers personal experience of issues that face all designers, expressed with sympathy and encouragement, and illustrated with examples of Inge Druckreys own work and that of grateful generations of her students. There are simple phrases that give insights into complex matters, for example that letterforms are 'memories of motion.' Above all, it is characteristic of Inge that in this examination of basic principles the word beautiful is used several times."
