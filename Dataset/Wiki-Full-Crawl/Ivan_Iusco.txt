In 2003 he composed the music for Mio Cognato, a movie by the same director, for which he received the 2004 Nastro d'Argento nomination for Best Soundtrack.
Iusco has partnered often with the well-known Italian director, Sergio Rubini, composing the main theme for the movie "LAnima Gemella" (2002), the soundtrack of LAmore Ritorna (2004) and an additional score for "Colpo DOcchio" (2008) which complemented the music of Pino Donaggio.

In 1987 he founded the pioneering Italian music label Minus Habens Records (involving artists such as Angelo Badalamenti, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin and Depeche Mode), through which he continues to explore and publish avant-garde and cutting edge music.
The track Mobili In Mobilis, taken from his album Transients (2015) has been nominated for the Best Instrumental Song by the American Songwriting Awards 2016.
His current projects include the soundtrack for Rex Starlight, a TV series pilot by the American scriptwriter Daniel Greenspan and the much-anticipated joint project titled Between with the Canadian artist Cassandra Cronenberg.
