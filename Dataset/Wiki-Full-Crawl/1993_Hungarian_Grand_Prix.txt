The 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Hungaroring on 15 August 1993. It was the eleventh race of the 1993 FIA Formula One World Championship.
The 77-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. After retiring from the lead in the previous two races, Hill finally took his first Formula One victory, becoming the first son of a World Champion to win a race himself. Riccardo Patrese finished second in a Benetton-Ford, achieving his final podium finish, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Another F1 veteran, Derek Warwick, scored his final points by finishing fourth in a Footwork-Mugen-Honda.
Hill's teammate and Drivers' Championship leader, Alain Prost, took pole position, but stalled on the warm-up lap and had to start from the back of the grid. He subsequently lost several laps due to a faulty rear wing - giving an interview for French television while the Williams team worked on his car.
