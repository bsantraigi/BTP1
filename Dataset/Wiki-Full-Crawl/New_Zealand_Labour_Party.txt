The New Zealand Labour Party (Mori: Rp Reipa o Aotearoa), or simply  Labour (Reipa), is a centre-left political party in New Zealand. The party's platform programme describes its founding principle as democratic socialism, while observers describe Labour as social-democratic and pragmatic in practice. It is a participant of the international Progressive Alliance.The New Zealand Labour Party was formed in 1916 by various socialist parties and trade unions. It is thus the country's oldest political party still in existence.  With its main rival, the New Zealand National Party, Labour has dominated New Zealand governments since the 1930s. To date, there have been six periods of Labour government under ten Labour prime ministers.
The party was first in power from 1935 to 1949, under Prime Ministers Michael Joseph Savage and Peter Fraser, when it established New Zealand's welfare state. It governed from 1957 to 1960, and again from 1972 to 1975, but only stayed in for one term each; in 1974 the government's popular Prime Minister Norman Kirk died in office, which contributed to a decline in support. Up to the 1980s the party advocated a strong role for governments in economic and social matters. When it governed from 1984 to 1990 Labour instead privatised state assets and reduced the role of the state in the economy. Labour Prime Minister David Lange also introduced New Zealand's nuclear-free policy. Labour was again the largest party from 1999 to 2008 when it governed in coalition with, or on the basis of negotiated support from, several minor parties; Helen Clark became the first Labour Prime Minister to lead her government through a third term in office.
Since the 2008 general election, Labour has comprised the second-largest caucus represented in the House of Representatives. In the 2017 general election, the party under Jacinda Ardern returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2005 general election, winning 36.9% of the party vote and 46 seats. On 19 October 2017, Labour formed a minority coalition government with New Zealand First, with confidence and supply from the Green Party. Jacinda Ardern currently serves as Labour Party Leader and Prime Minister, and Kelvin Davis is Deputy Leader.
