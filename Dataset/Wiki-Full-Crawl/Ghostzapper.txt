Ghostzapper (foaled April 6, 2000) is a Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Breeders' Cup Classic in 2004, outdistancing Roses in May by three lengths in a track record time of 1:59.02. His gate-to-wire Classic victory completed a 4-for-4 season, which earned him the 2004 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. He was also ranked "World's Top Ranked Horse" for 2004 as compiled by the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings. 
Although he only raced eleven times in his career, his performances earned him the highest accolades from horse racing publications. Ghostzapper was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2012.
