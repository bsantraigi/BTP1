Mandarin Dynasty is a band fronted by Mike Sherk, formed in Encinitas, California in 2004. The group is best known for extensively touring the American DIY music scene, as well as for releasing several bedroom pop albums, including Sea Legs (2005) and Perpendicular Crosstalk (2011).
Mandarin Dynasty's lineup has at times included members of Deer Tick and Dear Nora. The band's songs have been covered by such acts as Diamond Rugs (a supergroup featuring members of Los Lobos, Black Lips and Dead Confederate). Mandarin Dynasty's use of layered vocal harmonies and unconventional instrumentation has led press to compare the group to both The Beach Boys and Neutral Milk Hotel.
