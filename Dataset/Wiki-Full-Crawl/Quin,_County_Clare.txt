Quin (Irish: Cuinche, meaning "five ways") is a village in southeast County Clare in Ireland and a Catholic parish and civil parish of the same name. The main attraction, Quin Abbey, is open to the public, and although mostly ruined, much of the structure remains. The abbey was built on the foundations of an earlier Norman castle, and the foundations of three corner towers can still be seen. The name of the village is a reference in ancient Irish to the original five roads out of the village. The village is located in a district sometimes known as Plassey.
