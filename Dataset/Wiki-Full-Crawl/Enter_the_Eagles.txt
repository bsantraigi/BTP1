Enter the Eagles (also known in the United States as And Now You're Dead) is a 1998 Hong Kong action thriller film directed by Corey Yuen, and starring Michael Wong, Anita Yuen, Jordan Chan, Shannon Lee, Benny Urquidez and Jordan Andrew Perry.
Like Shannon Lee's late brother Brandon Lee's film Legacy of Rage (1986), this was Shannon Lee's first and only film produced in Hong Kong and co-stars Michael Wong, who played Michael Wan in Legacy of Rage.
