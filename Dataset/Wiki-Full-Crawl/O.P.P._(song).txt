"O.P.P." is a song by the American rap group Naughty by Nature. It was released in August 1991 as the lead single from their self-titled debut album Naughty by Nature. The song was one of the first rap songs to become a pop hit when it reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart. Its declaration, "Down Wit' O.P.P", was a popular catchphrase in the U.S. in the early-1990s. 
The song was a hugely successful single; Spin magazine named it one of the greatest singles of the 1990s, offering the brief verdict, "Ever wonder where Puffy came from?" It also made some media outlets' lists of one of the best rap songs of all time: including The Source, VH1 (No. 22), and  Rolling Stone (No. 80). The song was also ranked No. 20 on VH1's 40 Greatest Hip Hop Songs of the '90s.
