Leona Mindy Roberts Helmsley (July 4, 1920  August 20, 2007) was an American businesswoman, known for her flamboyant personality and her reputation for tyrannical behavior, earning her the sobriquet Queen of Mean.After allegations of non-payment were made by contractors hired to improve Helmsley's Connecticut home, she was investigated and convicted of federal income tax evasion and other crimes in 1989. Although having initially received a sentence of sixteen years, she was required to serve only nineteen months in prison and two months under house arrest. During the trial, a former housekeeper testified that she had heard Helmsley say: "We don't pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes," an aphorism which identified her the rest of her life.
