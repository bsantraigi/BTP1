Brand New Girlfriend is the second album from country music artist Steve Holy. It was released in 2006 on Curb Records. Prior to its release, Holy had charted five singles ("I'm Not Breakin'", "Rock-a-Bye Heart", "Put Your Best Dress On", "Go Home", and "It's My Time (Waste It If I Want To)") which were not released on albums, although they all charted.
The title track to Brand New Girlfriend became Holy's second Number One single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, a position that it held for one week. At the time, its thirty-six-week climb to Number One was the slowest climb to Number One since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990. This record was broken one year later by Tracy Lawrence's "Find Out Who Your Friends Are", which reached Number One on its forty-first chart week. "Brand New Girlfriend" also reached No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 60 on the Pop 100.
Following the title track, two other singles  "Come On Rain" and "Men Buy the Drinks (Girls Call the Shots)"  were released from this album, both peaking in the lower regions of the top 40 on the country charts. Also included is a cover of "All for the Love of Sunshine", which was previously a Number One country hit for Hank Williams, Jr. (and the Mike Curb Congregation) in 1970, while the song "Wrap Around" was originally recorded by Keith Anderson on his 2005 album Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll.
