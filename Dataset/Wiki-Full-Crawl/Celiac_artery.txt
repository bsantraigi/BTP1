The celiac (or coeliac; ) artery, also known as the celiac trunk, or truncus coeliacus, is the first major branch of the abdominal aorta.  
It is 1.25 cm in length.
Branching from the aorta at thoracic vertebra 12 (T12) in humans, it is one of three anterior/ midline branches of the abdominal aorta (the others are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries).
