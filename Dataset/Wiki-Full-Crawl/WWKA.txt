WWKA (92.3 FM) is a country radio station in Orlando, Florida. The station is owned by Cox Radio and has had a country format since 1982. Previous owners include The Outlet Company and New City Communications. Its studios are located in Orlando and the transmitter tower is in Bithlo.

The station was originally WDBO-FM, affiliated with WDBO and CBS-affiliated WDBO-TV, at the time owned by The Outlet Company. In 1983, WDBO-FM and WDBO were sold to Katz Broadcasting when Outlet decided to leave radio. WDBO gradually moved to talk radio over the remainder of the 1980s, while WDBO-FM changed its call letters and re-formatted from middle-of-the-road to country music, becoming K92FM. There was some initial resistance to the shift; three broadcasters locked themselves in the studio on December 21, 1982, in protest. The situation was resolved peacefully within a few hours.

WWKA is now owned by Cox Enterprises, the company that owns channel 6's competitor, ABC-affiliated WFTV. The WDBO-FM callsigns returned to the radio in August 2011 when WDBO moved to FM on the 96.5 MHz frequency, supplanting what was WHTQ, a rock station. In 2012, WWKA tweaked its branding, dropping the FM from its brand name.
WWKA also broadcasts in HD radio.
