HPI Savage is a line of radio-controlled monster trucks manufactured in Japan by Hobby Products International of Foothill Ranch, California, US.
The overall setup of the Savage, with its massive tires and tall suspension, make it a perfect truck for bashing, and also enables the model to be able to withstand tremendous abuse. The Savage is used for "bashing", which consists of jumps, flips, etc. and it shines in this area.
New for 2016 are the Savage XL Octane V2, Savage XL F5.9 and Savage XL Flux.
Several hobbyists have had success using the Savage for high speed using option tires and gearing. The current RC monster truck world speed record is held by a Savage, at 74 MPH.
