The Triple Bend Invitational Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race once held annually at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California but beginning in 2014, due to the closure of Hollywood Park, is held at Santa Anita Park. A Grade I event since 2004, in 2019 it was downgraded to Grade II. It is contested on the dirt over a distance of seven furlongs and is open to horses age three and older.
Inaugurated in 1952 as the Lakes And Flowers Handicap, in 1979 the name was changed to honor Frank McMahon's colt Triple Bend whose wins included the Santa Anita Handicap and who set a world record time of 1:19.80 for seven furlongs on dirt in winning the 1972 Los Angeles Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack. In 1980, Rich Cream broke that mark with another world record time for seven furlongs on dirt in winning the Triple Bend Handicap.
