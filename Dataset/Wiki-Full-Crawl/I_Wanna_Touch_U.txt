"I Wanna Touch U" is a 1993 single by English rock band Def Leppard from their 1992 album Adrenalize. It is the seventh single but only released on radio.
Drummer Rick Allen came up with a melody which he showed the rest of the band. Guitarists Steve Clark and Phil Collen and bass player Rick Savage worked on Allen's idea. Singer Joe Elliott and executive producer Mutt Lange wrote the lyrics.
