After the massive commercial success of their previous album, Smash, The Offspring entered the studio in the middle of 1996 to record a new album.  The title Ixnay on the Hombre  combines Pig Latin ("Ixnay" is the  version of the word "nix," familiar in 1940s Hollywood movies) and Spanish ("hombre", "man") to convey the message "fuck The Man", as in "fuck authority".Ixnay on the Hombre was a moderate success debuting at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart and it was well received by both critics and fans. The album was certified platinum in the US for the shipment of 1 million copies. Ixnay on the Hombre has sold around 3 million copies worldwide. The album contains the singles "All I Want", "Gone Away", "The Meaning of Life" and "I Choose" The first two singles later appeared on The Offspring's Greatest Hits album.
