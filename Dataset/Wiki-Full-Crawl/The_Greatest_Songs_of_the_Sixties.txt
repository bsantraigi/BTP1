The Greatest Songs of the Sixties is Barry Manilow's sequel album for The Greatest Songs of the Fifties. The album was another major hit for Manilow in the United States, selling nearly 50% more than his previous album in its opening week. As with its predecessor, this album was produced by Clive Davis, along with Manilow and David Benson. The classics performed in this album includes Frankie Valli's "Can't Take My Eyes Off You", Elvis Presley's #1 hit "Can't Help Falling in Love", Beatles' "And I Love Her" and Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the Night" (the latter first appeared on Manilow's Sinatra-tribute album Manilow Sings Sinatra in 1998).
