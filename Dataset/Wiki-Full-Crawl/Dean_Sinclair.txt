Dean Michael Sinclair (born 17 December 1984) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.
Sinclair came through the Norwich City youth academy and was promoted to the club's first team in 2002. He struggled to make an impact and joined Barnet two years later. He made 125 appearances for the club before joining Charlton Athletic, where he again struggled to hold down a place in the first team and eventually spent time on loan with Cheltenham Town and Grimsby Town as well as briefly returning to Barnet for a month. In 2010, he returned to Grimsby on a permanent basis but the season ended with a loan at Cambridge United. Following his release from Grimsby in 2011 he went on to have spells with Arlesey Town, Hayes & Yeading and Lowestoft Town before signing with Woking in August 2012. He was released just a few months later and signed with Sutton United in February 2013.
Whilst with Barnet, Sinclair was capped 5 times by the England C team, scoring one goal.
