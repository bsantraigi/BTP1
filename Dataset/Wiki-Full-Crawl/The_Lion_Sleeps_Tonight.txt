"The Lion Sleeps Tonight" is a song originally recorded by Solomon Linda under the title "Mbube" for the South African Gallo Record Company in 1939. Linda's version was written in Zulu, while the English lyrics were written by George David Weiss. The song was adapted and covered internationally by many pop and folk revival artists in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Weavers, Jimmy Dorsey, Yma Sumac, Miriam Makeba, and the Kingston Trio. In 1961, it became a number one hit in the United States as adapted in English with the best-known version by the doo-wop group the Tokens. It went on to earn millions in royalties from cover versions and film licensing.  The pop group Tight Fit had a number one hit in the UK with the song in 1982.
