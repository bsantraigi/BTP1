"Cotton Eye Joe" is a song by Swedish Eurodance group Rednex from their debut studio album Sex & Violins (1995). Sampling the traditional American folk song "Cotton-Eyed Joe", it combines the group's style with traditional American instruments such as banjos and fiddles. In 2002, "Cotton Eye Joe" was remixed in a dance version, and was released from Rednex's greatest hits album, The Best of the West.
