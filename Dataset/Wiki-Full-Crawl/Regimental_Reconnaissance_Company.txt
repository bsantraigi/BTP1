The 75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company (formerly known as Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment/RRD) is an elite special operations force that has  been a member of Joint Special Operations Command since 2005. The unit is believed to have become part of JSOC due to its extensive training and unique capabilities to conduct special reconnaissance and close target reconnaissance (CTR) operations, and advanced force operations (AFO). It is often referred as a Special Mission Unit (SMU).
