The Skyen Line (Norwegian: Skyenlinjen/Skyenlinja) is a tramway line running from Slottsparken to Skyen in Oslo, Norway. It is served by line 13 of the Oslo Tramway. It connects the Briskeby Line at Slottsparken to the Lilleaker Line at Skyen. 
The line was built on 2 March 1894 from Slottsparken to Skarpsno, and extended to Skyen in 1903, by Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei. At first a shuttle service was provided on the branch line, but by April a through service was offered to stbanen. The Skillebekk Line was extended on 31 December 1894 to Nobels gate, to Thune in 1901 and to Skyen on 21 June 1903. On 9 May 1919 the Lilleaker Line was built from Skyen to Lilleaker, as a suburban line.
