Fort Rucker is a U.S. Army post located primarily in Dale County, Alabama, United States.  It was named for a Civil War officer, Confederate General Edmund Rucker. The post is the primary flight training installation for U.S. Army Aviators and is home to the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) and the United States Army Aviation Museum. Small sections of the post also lie in Coffee, Geneva, and Houston counties.  Part of the Dale County section of the base is a census-designated place; its population was 4,636 at the 2010 census.The main post has entrances from three bordering cities, Daleville, Ozark and Enterprise.  In the years before the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main post (except airfields and other restricted areas) was an open post with unmanned gates allowing civilians to drive through.  Following the attacks, this policy was changed, and the post is now closed to unauthorized traffic and visitors.
