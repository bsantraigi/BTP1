The insurgency in Aceh was a conflict fought by the Free Aceh Movement  (GAM) between 1976 and 2005, with the goal of making the province of Aceh independent from Indonesia. The Indonesian state had designated it as the "Aceh Disturbance"  (or Pemberontakan Aceh). Effects of strong military offensive in 2003 and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake brought a peace deal and an end to the insurgency.
