Helmuth Johannsen (27 February 1920  3 November 1998) was a German football player and manager.
Johannsen played for FC St. Pauli, a club which he also served as vice-president for a year from 1987 to 1988,  but a war injury forced him to give up his playing career early. After World War II he went on to become a manager, most notably leading Eintracht Braunschweig to a surprising Bundesliga championship in 196667.From early May to the end of June 1965 he spent a few  weeks "on loan" from Braunschweig at Holstein Kiel taking the champions of the northern division of the then national second tier Regionalliga, through the matches of the promotion series for the Bundesliga, but finishing only third in a pool of four teams, behind Borussia Mnchengladbach around their young stars Gnter Netzer and Jupp Heynckes, and SSV Reutlingen from the state of Baden-Wrttemberg.
He also worked in Switzerland, winning the Swiss championship in 1978 with Grasshopper Club Zrich, and also reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup the same year.
