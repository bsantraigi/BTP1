The Occitans (Occitan: los occitans) are an indigenous Romance language-speaking ethnic group, originating in Occitania (southern France, northeastern Spain and northwestern Italy).The Occitan language is still used to varying levels by between 100,000 and 800,000 speakers in southern France and northern Italy. Since 2006, the Occitan language is recognized as one of the official languages in Catalonia, an autonomous region of Spain.
The Occitans are concentrated in Occitania, but also in big urban centres in neighbouring regions: Lyon, Paris, Turin, Barcelona. There are also Occitan speakers in Guardia Piemontese (Calabria, as well as Argentina, Mexico and the United States).
