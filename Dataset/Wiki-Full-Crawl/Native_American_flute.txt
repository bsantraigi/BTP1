The Native American flute is a flute that is held in front of the player, has open finger holes,
and has two chambers: one for collecting the breath of the player and a second chamber which creates sound.
The player breathes into one end of the flute
without the need for an embouchure.
A block on the outside of the instrument
directs the player's breath from the first chamber  called the slow air chamber 
into the second chamber  called the sound chamber.
The design of a sound hole at the proximal end of the sound chamber causes
air from the player's breath to vibrate.
This vibration causes a steady resonance of air pressure
in the sound chamber that creates sound.Native American flutes comprise a wide range of designs, sizes, and variations  far more varied than most other classes of woodwind instruments.
