Tori Richard is a Honolulu, Hawaii-based company which produces men's and women's resort wear. In its nearly 60-year history, the Tori Richard line has gone from exclusively women's fashions (featured in Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, Mademoiselle, Glamour, Town & Country, Life and other national publications) to a line of upscale resort apparel, including sport shirts, Aloha shirts, tropical dresses, swimwear, separates, handbags, interior accents and a range of fashion and lifestyle accessories. Tori Richard resort wear targets those who enjoy art, travel and a casually upscale lifestyle. The collections are introduced biannually in showrooms on the east and west coasts.
Founder Mort Feldman, an avid collector of Japanese antiques and screens, translated his passion into the East-West fabric prints that remain the Tori Richard signature. Textile print as an art form still defines the brand, as do fabrication, construction and attention to detail.
CEO Josh Feldman, Mort Feldman's son, leads the locally owned family business as it approaches its 60th year. In two generations, the company has gone from designing primarily women's wear to becoming an international brand. Through its 10 retail stores, website and 2,500 wholesale accounts, Tori Richard is sold in all 50 states, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Caribbean. The newest Tori Richard concept stores, primarily women's stores, are in Honolulu's Kahala Hotel & Resort and Mashpee Cape Cod, Massachusetts. More than 80 percent of Tori Richard sales are U.S. mainland-driven.
