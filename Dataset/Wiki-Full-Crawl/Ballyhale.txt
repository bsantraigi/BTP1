Ballyhale (Irish: Baile Hil) is a village in the south east of Ireland. Located in the south of County Kilkenny, south of the city of Kilkenny and roughly halfway to Waterford city.
The sport of hurling is popular in the area, and the local Gaelic Athletic Association team of Ballyhale Shamrocks are the most successful hurling club in All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship history. Local Kilkenny GAA hurler Henry Shefflin holds the record for the highest number of All Ireland Senior Hurling medals for a single player. 
The location is also close to the Mount Juliet golf course in nearby Thomastown. The food brand Glanbia, originally Avonmore, had its roots in a number of member-owned creameries, before becoming a global showcase coop brand for Irish agriculture. Ballyhale is also home to Kiltorcan's Old Quarry. Ballyhale also played a historic role when, in 1832, approximately 200,000 people from four counties gathered in support of those on trial for the 1831 Battle of Carrickshock.
The parish of Ballyhale is made up of three areas; Knockmoylan and the villages of Ballyhale and Knocktopher. The population of the Ballyhale district is 335.
