Francisco Jos Debali (26 July 1791  13 January 1859), born Debly Ferenc Jzsef, was a Hungarian-born composer who emigrated to Uruguay in 1838. He authored the national anthem of Uruguay  and, possibly, the tune to Paraguayos, Repblica o Muerte, which became the Paraguayan anthem. (See National Anthem of Uruguay#Music.)
