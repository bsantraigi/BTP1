Essential Rarities is a compilation album by The Doors, originally released as part of the boxed set The Complete Studio Recordings in 1999, but reissued in 2000 as a single CD, containing studio cuts, live cuts and demos taken from the 1997 The Doors: Box Set.
All the tracks on this album have been officially released on the 1997 box set, with the exception of the bonus track "Woman Is a Devil", that was edited from the 1969 Elektra Sound Recorders Studios, 962 La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, 90069, "Rock Is Dead" sessions, and was not included in the box set version of the album.
Also, some songs appear in more complete form than their Box Set versions: "Roadhouse Blues" has a 35-second section that was cut from the bridge of the song, and "Who Scared You" has an extra verse.
