924 Forestville St. is the debut album by American punk rock band Bracket, released by Caroline Records on May 24, 1994.  Recording sessions were held at Prairie Sun Studios in Cotati, California with producer Joe Marquez.  Bracket issued two singles from the album, including "Why Should Eye" in the United States and "Huge Balloon" released in the United Kingdom.  924 Forestville St. is likely a tongue-in-cheek reference combining the name of longtime Bay Area punk rock establishment 924 Gilman Street with the band's nearby hometown of Forestville, California.
