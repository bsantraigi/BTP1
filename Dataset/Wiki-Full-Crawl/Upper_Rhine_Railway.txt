The MannheimKarlsruheBasel railway is a double-track electrified mainline railway in the German state of Baden-Wrttemberg. It runs from Mannheim via Heidelberg, Bruchsal, Karlsruhe, Rastatt, Baden-Baden, Offenburg and Freiburg to Basel, Switzerland. It is also known as the Rhine Valley Railway (German: Rheintalbahn) or the Upper Rhine Railway (Oberrheinbahn).
The line was built as part of the Baden Mainline (Badische Hauptbahn). Between Mannheim and Rastatt it runs parallel to the Baden Rhine Railway (Rheinbahn). The KarlsruheBasel high-speed railway, called the Ausbau- und Neubaustrecke KarlsruheBasel in German (literally: "Upgraded and new line KarlsruheBasel"), has been under construction since April 1987. This includes upgrading the current line to four-tracks in places and the construction of new line elsewhere. It was originally envisaged as being completed in 2008, but no final date for completion is now envisaged (as of 2015).
The MannheimBasel railway is one of the most important routes in the Deutsche Bahn network.
