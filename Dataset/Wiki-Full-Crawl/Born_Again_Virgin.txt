A born-again virgin (also known as a secondary virgin or renewed virgin)  is a person who, after having engaged in copulation, makes some type of commitment not to be sexually active again until marriage (or some other defined point in the future or indefinitely), whether for religious, moral, practical, or other reasons and is subsequently considered by some a virgin.
