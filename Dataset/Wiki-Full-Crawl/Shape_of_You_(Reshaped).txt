"Shape of You (Reshaped)" was the fourth and final single from Beverley Knight's album, Who I Am. It was a remix of the album track "Shape of You", featuring new vocals, lyrics and production by Wyclef Jean and was included on a re-release of the album in 2003. The remixed track was originally due for release in November 2002 but due to promotional reasons it was put back until early 2003. The single was a limited edition, containing a sticker, which by UK chart rules makes the single unable to qualify for the charts. The B-side "Whatever's Clever" has been release as a single in several south European countries, like Italy or Switzerland.
The video for the single was directed by Max & Dania.
