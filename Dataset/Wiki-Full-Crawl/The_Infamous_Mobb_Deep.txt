The Infamous Mobb Deep is the eighth and final studio album by American hip hop duo Mobb Deep, which is composed of Havoc and Prodigy. The album was released on April 1, 2014, by Prodigy's Infamous Records and Sony's RED Distribution. The Infamous Mobb Deep is a double album that consists of one disc of new original music and another of unreleased tracks from the recording sessions from their second studio album The Infamous (1995). The album has been in development since 2011, but was delayed by a feud that occurred between Havoc and Prodigy during 2012. However, they shortly reconciled.
The duo toured to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut studio album during 2013. This led to the two reconvening to get back into the album's recording process. The album's production was handled by Havoc, Boi-1da, Illmind and The Alchemist among others. The album contains guest appearances from  French Montana, Juicy J, The LOX, Bun B, Busta Rhymes, Nas, and Snoop Dogg among others. The 1994 Infamous Sessions contains guest appearances from Big Noyd,  Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, and Nas. The album was supported by the singles "Taking You off Here" and "Say Something".
