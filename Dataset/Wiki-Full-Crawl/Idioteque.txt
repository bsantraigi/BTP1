"Idioteque" is a song by the English rock band Radiohead, released on their fourth album, Kid A (2000). Primarily electronic and dance-oriented in style, the song was hailed as a radical departure from the band's earlier guitar-driven music.

The song is listed at #8 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s, and ranked #56 on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.In 2008, the song was featured on Radiohead: The Best Of.
