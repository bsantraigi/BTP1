The Ghost Camera is a 1933 British mystery film directed by Bernard Vorhaus, starring Henry Kendall, Ida Lupino and John Mills, and based on "A Mystery Narrative", a short story by Joseph Jefferson Farjeon.
Despite being made quickly on a low budget, the film has come to be considered as one of the most successful Quota quickies made during the Thirties.
