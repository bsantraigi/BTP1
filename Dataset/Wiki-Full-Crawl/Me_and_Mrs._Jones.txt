"Me and Mrs. Jones" is a 1972 soul song written by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Cary Gilbert, and originally recorded by Billy Paul. It describes an extramarital affair between a man and his lover, Mrs. Jones. In the song, the two meet in secret "every day at the same cafe", where they hold hands and talk. The two are caught in a quandary: "we both know that it's wrong/but it's much too strong/to let it go now".
