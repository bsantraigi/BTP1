Unholy Desire or Intentions of Murder (, Akai Satsui, literally "Red Murderous Intent") is a 1964 Japanese film by director Shohei Imamura. This film embodies many of the central interests in Imamura's career including strong, lower-class women who survive in spite of their oppressive surroundings, and an earthy, humorous approach to sex.
