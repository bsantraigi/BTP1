Jamaica College (abbreviated J.C. or JC) is a prominent all-male secondary school located in Kingston, Jamaica. It provides traditional classroom education to its students in a variety of subject areas.
The institution caters to students aged 10 to 19 years. First established as a boarding school for boys, Jamaica College has remained a single-sex school with the boarding facilities removed. The school provides education to around 1,800 boys and has over 100 teaching and administrative staff.
During the 18th century when Jamaica prospered as a sugar colony of the British Empire, several large donations were made for the funding of schools. The objective of these bequests was usually to provide free education for the poor of the parish to which the benefactor belonged. Jamaica College is a product of such a bequest.
The institution is widely known in Jamaica for both its academic and sports achievements, and has had the privilege of producing many influential members of Jamaican society, notably former Prime Ministers of Jamaica, Michael Manley and Bruce Golding, and former Chief Minister and Premier of Jamaica, Norman Washington Manley, who is also the father of Michael Manley and the founder of the People's National Party.
