"Marchin On" is a song by the American pop rock band OneRepublic, and is written and produced by frontman Ryan Tedder for the group's second studio album Waking Up (2009). Producer and rapper Timbaland included a remixed version of the song for his 2009 album Shock Value II. As the title of the song is "Marchin On" it has a marching beat with a bass drum which is a good foundation for an electronic remix.
The track was released as the album's third single in German-speaking Europe in June 2010, where it served as German TV channel ZDF's promotional FIFA 2010 World Cup song and it was also used by HBO to promote their 2012 programming line up. The song was used in the episode 20 ("Blood Brothers") of season 1 of The CW series The Vampire Diaries.
Originally, the song "Good Life" was supposed to serve as the third single, but due to "Marchin On" being selected for FIFA, "Good Life" had to be pushed back to being the fourth single.
