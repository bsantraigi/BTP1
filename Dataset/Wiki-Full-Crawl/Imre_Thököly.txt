Emeric Thkly de Ksmrk (Hungarian: ksmrki Thkly Imre; Slovak: Imrich Tkli; 25 September 1657  13 September 1705) was prince of Upper Hungary from 1682 to 1685, and prince of Transylvania in 1690. His father, Count Istvn Thkly, held large domains in Royal Hungary. Emeric's mother, Mria Gyulaffy, was related to three princes of Transylvania. He was a child when he inherited his mother's estates in Transylania proper and the domains of his uncle, Count Francis Rhdey, Prince of Transylvania,  in Mramaros County. Istvn Thkly was involved in the leading aristocrats' conspiracy against the Habsburg monarch, Leopold I, and died fighting against the royal troops in late 1670. Emeric fled to the Principality of Transylvania and his estates in Royal Hungary were confiscated.
