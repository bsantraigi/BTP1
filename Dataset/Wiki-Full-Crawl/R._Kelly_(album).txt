R. Kelly is the second studio album by R&B singer R. Kelly. It was released on November 14, 1995. The album was somewhat of a departure from his previous album's sexual innuendos, featuring slightly more introspective lyrics. R. Kelly was the artist's second number 1 R&B album and the first one to top the Billboard 200; it spawned three number 1 R&B singles in chronological order: "You Remind Me of Something", "Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)" and "I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)".
