"You Don't Miss Your Water ('Til the Well Runs Dry)" is the sixth and final single from Craig David's second album Slicker Than Your Average. The song became one of his lowest charting singles to date, likely because it was the sixth single from the album and at the time of single release Slicker Than Your Average was already certified double platinum in the UK alone.
"You Don't Miss Your Water ('Til the Well Runs Dry)" charted at number 43 in the UK.
This was the first Craig David song and one of the first CD singles to incorporate the two-track CD format in the UK.
