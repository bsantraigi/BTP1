P minuten (English lit.: On the minute meaning "within the confines of a minute") is a Swedish radio panel game similar to the BBC's Just a Minute. Recorded before a live audience, it is broadcast on Sveriges Radio P1 on Saturdays at 16.03, with a repeat the following day at 18.00. The recordings are made at Sveriges Radio, or sometimes at Stockholm City Theatre's Soppteater (caf-theatre).
