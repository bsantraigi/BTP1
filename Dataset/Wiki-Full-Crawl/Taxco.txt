Taxco de Alarcn (usually referred to as simply Taxco) (Spanish ['tasko] ) is a small city and administrative center of a Taxco de Alarcn Municipality located in the Mexican state of Guerrero.  Taxco is located in the north-central part of the state, 36 kilometres (22 miles) from the city of Iguala, 135 kilometres (84 miles) from the state capital of Chilpancingo and 170 kilometres (106 miles) southwest of Mexico City.
The city is heavily associated with silver, both with the mining of it and other metals and for the crafting of it into jewelry, silverware and other items. Today, mining is no longer a mainstay of the city's economy.  The city's reputation for silverwork, along with its picturesque homes and surrounding landscapes, have made tourism the main economic activity.
