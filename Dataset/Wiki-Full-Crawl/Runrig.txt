Runrig were a Scottish Celtic rock band formed on the Isle of Skye, Scotland in 1973. From its inception, the band's line-up included songwriters Rory Macdonald and Calum Macdonald. The final line-up also included longtime members Malcolm Jones, Iain Bayne, and latterly, Bruce Guthro, and Brian Hurren. The band released fourteen studio albums, with a number of their songs sung in Scottish Gaelic.
Initially formed as a three-piece dance band known as 'The Run Rig Dance Band', the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a ceilidh at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow as their first concert. Runrig's music is often described as a blend of folk and rock music, with the band's lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to agriculture, land conservation and religion.
Since 1999, the band has gained attention in Canada, following Nova Scotian singer Bruce Guthro's entry to the band. In 2016, the band announced that it would retire from studio recording after the release of its 14th studio album, The Story and announced their final tour The Last Mile in 2017. On 17 and 18 August 2018, Runrig performed the final shows of their farewell tour, entitled The Last Dance, in Stirling City Park beneath the castle ramparts. An estimated 52,000 fans attended The Last Dance.
