Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) is an independent professional wrestling promotion based in Louisville, Kentucky. It was initially a member promotion of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from its inception in 1993 until 2000, when it became the primary developmental territory for the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). It remained in this role from 2000 until 2008. The promotion was unaffiliated from February 7, 2008 until November 2011, and is currently run by Al Snow, who took over from founder and former owner Nightmare Danny Davis.
In 2012, OVW became the farm territory for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) (now Impact Wrestling). The relationship ended on November 2, 2013. 
As of December 2011, over 100 OVW alumni have appeared in WWE.
