The Gorgon is a 1964 British horror film directed by Terence Fisher for Hammer Films.
It stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Barbara Shelley and Richard Pasco. Written by John Gilling and directed by Terence Fisher, the film was photographed by Michael Reed, and designed by Bernard Robinson. For the score James Bernard combined a soprano with a little-known electronic instrument called the Novachord. The film marks one of the few occasions when Hammer turned to Greek mythology for inspiration; this time it is the legend of the Gorgon that is respun for the Hammer audiences.
