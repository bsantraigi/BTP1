The fiveband barb (Desmopuntius pentazona) is a species of cyprinid fish native to Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.The fish superficially resembles the tiger barb (D. tetrazona), except that there are five black vertical bands on an orange or gold body instead of four bands on the tiger barb. The fish will grow to a maximum length of 8.8 centimetres (3.5 in) TL.The fish lives natively in calm tropical waters in the lowlands in water with a 56 pH, a water hardness of 512.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 7484 F (2329 C).The fish has commercial importance in the aquarium hobby and is frequently inaccurately referred to as a tiger barb.Fiveband barbs are egg-scatterers that spawn among a course gravel bed in open water. Once spawning is finished, they will usually eat any of the approximately 200 eggs that they find. It is usually necessary to separate the fish from the eggs after spawning in order to prevent the eggs from being eaten. The eggs will hatch in approximately 1 day.
