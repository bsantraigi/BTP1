Attack on Memory is the second studio album and third LP overall by Cloud Nothings. It was released on January 24, 2012 by Carpark Records and was engineered by Steve Albini at his Electrical Audio studio in Chicago.  The album is the first to include frontman Dylan Baldi's live band as full-time members and co-writers, and has been noted for its heavier sound and darker songs, a sharp turn from the power pop of previous releases.
