The Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association (CVMA) is an association of Veterans from all branches of the United States Armed Forces who ride motorcycles as a hobby.   The CVMA mission is to support and defend those who have defended their country and their freedoms.  The focus of the CVMA is to help Veteran care facilities provide a warm meal, clothing, shelter, and guidance, or simply to say "thank you" and "welcome home."
The association's members are Full Members (those with verified combat service) or Supporter Members (those who have non-combat military service, and have a sincere dedication to helping veterans).  The CVMA has members from all 50 states and living abroad.  Many members continue to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States.
The CVMA sponsors and participates in many motorcycle-related charity events each year, and as a non-profit organization, donate to various Veteran care facilities and Veteran charities.
