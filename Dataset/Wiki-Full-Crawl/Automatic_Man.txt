Automatic Man was an American 1970s progressive rock quartet from San Francisco which also featured elements of funk, space music, psychedelic rock, heavy metal, Krautrock, Musique concrte, art rock and Santana-inspired jazz fusion.  Automatic Man brought together well-respected musicians of diverse backgrounds within the rock, funk and jazz communities of the mid-1970s.
Despite a well-reviewed 1976 eponymous dbut on Island Records and a lone charting single, 1976's "My Pearl", which reached No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100., the line-up of Automatic Man was not cohesive. After a second album entitled Visitors, they disbanded in 1977, retaining a small but very loyal, global cult following.
With both releases being reissued on CD in 2004 after 28 years of only being available in vinyl format and with the advent of the internet, Automatic Man are being rediscovered and roundly praised for their genre-defying, boundary-breaking musical sound and unique lyrics.
