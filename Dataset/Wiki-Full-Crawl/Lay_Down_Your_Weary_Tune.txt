"Lay Down Your Weary Tune" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1963. He originally recorded it for his album The Times They Are a-Changin', but it was not released until 1985 on the Biograph box set. In the album liner notes, Dylan claims that in the song he was trying to capture the feeling of a Scottish ballad he had just heard on a 78 rpm record. The specific ballad Dylan was referring to has not been identified, but speculation includes "The Water Is Wide",  "O Waly, Waly" and "I Wish, I Wish".Los Angeles folk rock group the Byrds recorded "Lay Down Your Weary Tune" for their 1965 album Turn! Turn! Turn!. The song was subsequently recorded by several artists.
