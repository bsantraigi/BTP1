James Gauld (9 May 1931  9 December 2004) was a Scottish footballer, who played as an inside forward. He began his career with Aberdeen but failed to make a first team appearance before being released. Gauld went on to play in the Highland League for Huntly and Elgin City, and then played in the League of Ireland for Waterford. In his one season with the club, he finished as top goalscorer in the League of Ireland with 30 goals. His form led to a move to England in 1955, where he joined Charlton Athletic. Gauld was transferred to Everton the following year, and then joined Plymouth Argyle in 1957. Two seasons later, he was on the move again, joining Swindon Town for a club record fee.
In 1960, Gauld spent a brief period with St Johnstone and then moved to Mansfield Town, where a broken leg ended his career. It was after his playing days had finished that he gained notoriety for instigating and then exposing match fixing in the game. Gauld enticed several players into betting on the outcome of fixed matches, including England internationals Tony Kay and Peter Swan. In 1964, Gauld sold his story to the Sunday People for 7,000, incriminating Kay, Swan and former teammate David Layne in the process. Described by The Times as the "ringleader", Gauld was sentenced to four years imprisonment and fined 5,000. In total, 33 players were prosecuted for their involvement in the 1964 British betting scandal.
