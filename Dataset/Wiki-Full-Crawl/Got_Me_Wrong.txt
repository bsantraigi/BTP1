"Got Me Wrong" is a largely acoustic single by the American rock band Alice in Chains. The studio version was first featured on the band's EP Sap (1992). A slightly different version of the song also appeared on the soundtrack to the 1994 independent comedy film Clerks, and is played when the character Randal first appears in the movie.
