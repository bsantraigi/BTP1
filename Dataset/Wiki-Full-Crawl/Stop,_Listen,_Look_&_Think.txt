"Stop, Listen, Look & Think" is a song by the American girl group Expos. It was written and produced by the group's founder, Lewis Martine, and can be found on their 1989 second album, What You Don't Know. It was the first single released by Expos to feature Ann Curless on lead vocals.
The song was also included on the soundtrack to the Lambada-themed film The Forbidden Dance, which was released in the U.S. in March 1990. 
Allmusic states that "Stop, Listen, Look & Think" is one of the best tracks on What You Don't Know and describes it as "a subtler uptempo number with an understated yet memorable lead by" Curless.
