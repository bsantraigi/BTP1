Vileevils was an electronic dance duo, formed when the 2005 reunion of Pop Will Eat Itself (PWEI) failed to become a full-time project.  Singer Clint Mansell and guitarist Richard March were too busy with side projects to dedicate themselves to writing and performing new material, and so the remaining three members of the band decided to form the spin-off band Vileevils, utilising the Sonic Noise Byte material that PWEI had written following the reunion.The band toured extensively in the UK, before reorganising as a more minimalist two-piece, after Fuzz left the band in 2007.  On 23 February 2010, Vile Evils announced that they had disbanded, and that Graham Crabb would move on to reconstitute Pop Will Eat Itself.
