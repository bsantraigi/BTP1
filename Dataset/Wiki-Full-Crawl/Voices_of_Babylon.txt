Voices of Babylon is the third studio album by the British band The Outfield, released during the spring of 1989 and which spawned an eponymous single.  It was the group's last album to feature drummer Alan Jackman until the release of Replay in 2011. It was also their final album on the Columbia label. Following the album's release, and with their commercial success slipping, the band parted ways with drummer Alan Jackman and soon hired Paul Reed as a replacement for the album's tour.
This album features a unique script similar to what is known as the Pigpen cipher. On the album cover, the script says "OUTFIELD", and the liner notes show the title of each album track in that same script.
