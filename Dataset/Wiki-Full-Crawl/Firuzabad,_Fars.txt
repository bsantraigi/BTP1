Firuzabad (Persian:  also Romanized as Frzbd; Middle Persian: Gr or Ardashir-Khwarrah, literally "The Glory of Ardashir"; also Shahr-e Gr  ) is a city and capital of Firuzabad County, Fars Province, Iran.  At the 2006 census, its population was 58,210, in 12,888 families. Firuzabad is located south of Shiraz. The city is surrounded by a mud wall and ditch.
The original ancient city of Gor, dating back to the Achaemenid period, was destroyed by Alexander the Great. Centuries later, Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanian Empire, revived the city before it was ransacked during the Arab Muslim invasion of the seventh century. It was again revived by the Buyids, but was eventually abandoned in the Qajar period and was replaced by a nearby town, which is now Firuzabad.
