Jamesport is a census-designated place (CDP) and hamlet in the Town of Riverhead in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The CDP's population was 1,710 at the 2010 census.

Jamesport is known for its quaint downtown area including antique shops and a handful of fine restaurants. The population of the hamlet grows considerably during the summer months due to the influx of day-tourists and vacationers taking advantage of the Great Peconic Bay beaches located on the south side of the hamlet. During the late summer/fall months, the hamlet is busy once again, due to "pumpkin pickers", "wine tasters", and other tourists taking in the beautiful fall scenery Jamesport has to offer. Jamesport is home to many farms including sod, pumpkin, flower, potato and wineries. Jamesport State Park is located north of Jamesport in the adjacent hamlet of Northville. A 2010 park master plan called for it to be renamed the "Hallock State Park Preserve".
