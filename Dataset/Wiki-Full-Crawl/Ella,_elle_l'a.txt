"Ella, elle l'a" (French for "Ella, She Has It") is a single released by French singer France Gall. It was released as a single from her album Babacar, on 24 August 1987, and became a hit across Europe, the Americas (especially in Quebec and the Southern Cone) and Asia (especially in Japan)
Written by Michel Berger, the song is a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, but also a protest against racism and an anthem to personal empowerment. Musically, "it swings between sheared rhythms of the bass and flashed brass". The song is also available on the CD maxi for videmment, released on March 1988. In addition, a live version from her concert album Le Tour de France was released in November that year.
The song had great success between 1987 and 1988, reaching number one in Austria and Germany in the latter year; plus reaching the Top 10 in Sweden, Spain and Argentina. In France, the single was certified as silver disc by the SNEP, reaching #2. It was on the chart Top 50 during nineteen weeks, from October 24th 1987; and nine weeks on the Top 10. In addition, it won two Victoires de la Musique in both years. It was covered live by French singer Alize at a TV show in 2002 and by Belgian singer Kate Ryan in a dance version in 2008.
