Saint Gaetano Errico (19 October 1791 - 29 October 1860) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest from Naples and the founder of the Missionari dei Sacri Cuori di Ges e Maria. Errico was born to devout and hardworking parents whose income was modest but sufficient for him to do his ecclesial studies in Naples. It was common for him to be seen twice a week tending to the ill despite his studies and he also helped his father on occasion at his warehouse. He became a teacher after his ordination and later a parish priest.Errico became better known for having had a vision while on a retreat in 1818 in which Saint Alfonso Maria de' Liguori came to him in a vision requesting he both found a religious congregation and oversee the establishment of a new church dedicated to the Blessed Mother. Errico did this despite several obstacles though did not see it through to the end until just over a decade later.His canonization cause was introduced under Pope Leo XIII in 1884 and he became titled as a Servant of God; Pope Paul VI later named him as Venerable in 1974 upon confirming his heroic virtue while Pope John Paul II later beatified him on 14 April 2002. Pope Benedict XVI canonized Errico as a saint on 12 October 2008 in Saint Peter's Square.
