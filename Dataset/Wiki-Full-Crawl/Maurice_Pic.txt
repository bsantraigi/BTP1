Maurice Pic (23 March 1866, Marrigny near Digoin  29 December 1957, Les Guerreaux) was a French entomologist who specialised in Coleoptera. He contributed to Mary-Louis Fauconnet's Catalogue raisonn des coloptres de Sane-et-Loire (Le Creusot, Martet, 1887) and wrote many short papers, many in L'change, Revue Linnenne describing world beetles. His most important work was for Sigmund Schenkling's still very relevant Coleopterorum Catalogus.
Pic's collection is in the Musum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris.
