Pharoah Sanders (born Farrell Sanders, October 13, 1940) is an American jazz saxophonist.
Saxophonist Ornette Coleman once described him as "probably the best tenor player in the world".  Emerging from John Coltrane's groups of the mid-1960s, Sanders is known for his overblowing, harmonic, and multiphonic techniques on the saxophone, as well as his use of "sheets of sound". Sanders is an important figure in the development of free jazz; Albert Ayler famously said: "Trane was the Father, Pharoah was the Son, I am the Holy Ghost".
