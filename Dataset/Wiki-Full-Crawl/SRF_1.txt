SRF 1 is a German-language Swiss television channel, one of three produced by the SRG SSR public-service broadcasting group (the others being SRF zwei and SRF info). The channel, formerly known as SF1, was renamed on 16 December 2012, together with its sister German-speaking TV channels and five radio channels, as part of an exercise aimed at emphasizing their common ownership as well as establishing a shared web presence for all of them.
The channel promotes itself as "a full-service channel with a high proportion of home-produced content, especially documentaries and dramas" that offers "news and current affairs, education, the arts, and entertainment for all".
