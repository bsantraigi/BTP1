Flushing is a city in Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan.  The population was 8,389 at the 2010 census. Flushing is considered a suburb of Flint. It is situated within the survey area of Flushing Charter Township, but is administratively autonomous.
Flushing originated as a mill town in the mid-1830s. Its location along the Flint River, the countys largest river, was a decisive factor in its settlement. Water power potential was a significant determinant for the selection of the settlement areas throughout the nineteenth century. In addition to its water power, the area around Flushing was also well suited to agricultural pursuits.The name Dover originally was selected for the new village until it was discovered that the name already was in use in Lenawee County Michigan. Charles Seymour, Sr., former resident of Flushing, Long Island, subsequently named the new community after the village in New York State.
