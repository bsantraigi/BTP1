"Stand Back" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her second solo studio album The Wild Heart (1983). It was released as the lead single from the album in May 1983 and went to number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Top Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in August of that year. The song has been a staple in Nicks' live shows since its pre-album debut at the 1983 US Festival, and it has also been included in Fleetwood Mac tour set lists since 1987.
In the United Kingdom, the single was given Nicks' first 12" release, featuring a different glossy picture sleeve and the inclusion of a third track, "Wild Heart". A 12" promotional single was also released to United States radio stations in 1983, featuring a full-colour sleeve, but playing the standard album version (in mono and stereo) on both sides.
