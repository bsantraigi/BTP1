Kriminalpolizei (German pronunciation: [krminalpolitsa] (listen), "criminal police") is the standard term for the criminal investigation agency within the police forces of Germany, Austria and the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland. In Nazi Germany, the Kripo was the criminal police department for the entire Reich. Today, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the state police (Landespolizei) perform the majority of investigations. Its Criminal Investigation Department is known as the Kriminalpolizei or more colloquially, the Kripo.
The equivalent division of the Norwegian Police is known as Kripos, derived from a similar acronym in Norwegian.
