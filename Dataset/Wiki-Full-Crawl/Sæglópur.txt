"Sglpur" (Icelandic for "lost at sea" or "lost seafarer") is a song by Sigur Rs, released in 2006 as a single from the 2005 album Takk....  Parts of the song are in Icelandic, although a lengthy portion is in Hopelandic, a "language" of nonsense words selected by the band that sound similar to Icelandic.
