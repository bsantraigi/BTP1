The World Sportscar Championship was the world series run for sports car racing by the FIA from 1953 to 1992.
The championship evolved from a small collection of the most important sportscar, endurance, and road racing events in Europe and North America with dozens of gentleman drivers at the grid, to a professional racing series where the world's largest automakers spent millions of dollars per year. The official name of the series changed throughout the years, however it has generally been known as the World Sportscar Championship from its inception in 1953.  The World Sportscar Championship was, with the Formula One World Championship, one of the two major world championships in circuit motor racing.
In 2012 the World Sportscar Championship was revived and renamed as the World Endurance Championship.
