Antonio Pea Promotions, S.A de CV d/b/a Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, or simply AAA (an abbreviation of its original name Asistencia Asesora y Administracin, Spanish for "Assistance, Assessment, and Administration") is a Mexican Lucha Libre (professional wrestling) promotion based in Mexico City, Mexico. Founded in 1992 when Antonio Pea broke away from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to set up a promotion, which allowed him more creative freedom, AAA has held a number of pay-per-views (PPV) over the years and has promoted shows not just in Mexico but in the United States and Japan as well. 
In addition to the conventional "squared circle", the promotion occasionally uses a hexagonal wrestling ring and has a reputation for its outlandish gimmicks and characters as well as having developed a more extreme match style in recent years. Over the years AAA has worked together with several North American promotions such as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and World Championship Wrestling, while currently having working relationships with the Japanese Pro Wrestling Noah and the American Impact Wrestling promotions
