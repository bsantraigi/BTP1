Parramatta Stadium was a sports stadium in Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia, 23 kilometres west of Sydney's central business district. The stadium was the home ground of several western Sydney-based sports teams, at the time of closure the most notable were the Parramatta Eels of the National Rugby League and the Western Sydney Wanderers  of the A-League.
Cumberland Oval was the local name for the cricket, motor sports & rugby venue that had existed prior to Parramatta Stadium being built, with the area having been used for recreational activities since 1788, the founding year of the British colony in New South Wales.
The stadium also hosted numerous other sporting and cultural events since its opening in 1986. Michael Jackson performed there during his Bad World Tour on 2021 November 1987, and Paul McCartney concluded the Australian leg of The New World Tour with two shows there on 2223 March 1993.
In 2015 the NSW Government announced that the stadium would be demolished & replaced, and to that end, Parramatta Stadium was demolished in February 2017, with the new Western Sydney Stadium being built in the same location.
