Packed! is the fifth album by rock group The Pretenders, released in 1990.
Besides band leader Chrissie Hynde, no other person is pictured anywhere within the album package. At the time the album was recorded, the only remaining official member from the band's previous album was drummer Blair Cunningham, who plays on all tracks, though he is not credited as part of the band. As all other musicians appearing on the album are session musicians, the album can be argued to be de facto solo album by Hynde, only using the Pretenders name to satisfy contractual obligations. However, the lineup that recorded the album has some consistency with past studio lineups of the band: Guitarist Billy Bremner, who had previously played with the band as a session musician on their "Back on the Chain Gang/My City Was Gone" single, appears on most of the tracks, as does bassist John McKenzie, who had played some bass on the band's previous album, Get Close.
