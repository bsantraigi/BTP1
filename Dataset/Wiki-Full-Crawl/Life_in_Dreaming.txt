Life in Dreaming is Hidden in Plain View's first full-length album, released on February 22, 2005 by Drive-Thru Records. It was originally scheduled for an August 2004 release, but was postponed until February 2005 to gain time for promotion. The album includes an Enhanced CD portion with video footage of a live performance of "Twenty Below" at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California and a making-of featurette.
During the recording session, two additional songs were recorded, which the band originally wrote in late 2001. "Hot & Sexy" was released on the B-side of the British vinyl single for "Ashes Ashes". The other track, "To Your Grave", remains unreleased. The Japanese edition of the album features none of these as bonus tracks, but two tracks which were originally released on the in-Japan-unavailable Hidden in Plain View EP.
The album was released on limited edition vinyl by Company Ink Records and Drive-Thru Records in March 2013.
