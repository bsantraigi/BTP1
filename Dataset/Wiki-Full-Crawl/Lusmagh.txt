Lusmagh is an area and townland in County Offaly, Ireland, situated approximately three miles south-west of Banagher. It is bounded on three sides by rivers, the River Shannon, the River Lusmagh and the Little Brosna River. It is also a Roman Catholic parish, in the Diocese of Clonfert, the only parish in the Diocese east of the River Shannon. Prior to 1373, Lusmagh was in the province of Connacht. According to the history of the O'Kellys of Hy-Many, the name means the plain of the healing herbs. In Christian times, the parish was named Cill Mochonna (the Church of Mochonna), after Saint Mochonna. Saint Crnn founded a monastery in the parish that survived for many centuries. The name Lusmagh was restored to the Parish around 1810. The present Roman Catholic parish church is named after St. Crnn.
