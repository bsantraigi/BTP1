Incentive Software Ltd. was a British video game developer and publisher founded by Ian Andrew in 1983. Programmers included Sean Ellis, Stephen Northcott and Ian's brother Chris Andrew. Later games were based on the company's Freescape rendering engine. The company was renamed Dimension International as it moved into the VR field with its next-generation Superscape VRT engine, then later changed name again to Superscape.
