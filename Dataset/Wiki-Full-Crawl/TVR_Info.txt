TVR Info (Romanian pronunciation: [tevere info]) was a niche TV channel that broadcast 24/7 mainly news, utility information, and live traffic images from the major cities through the country. It was the second niche channel of the public TV broadcaster, after TVR Cultural.
The channel aired utility info, such as traffic and airport weather. Every hour it broadcast news (politic, international, sports, weather), in a like-EuroNews format (no presenters, just image and sound).
In 2011 TVR operated a rebranding of the channel and a significant programme change. Then it had a more dynamic programme, with news every hour and debates in between, competing the other news channels, Antena 3 and Realitatea.
On August 15, 2012 it was relaunched under a new name: TVR News.
