21st Century Live is a live album by the band Styx released in 2003.  The album contains a CD and a DVD.
The tracks on the CD are identical to the tracks released on Styx World: Live 2001 (2001), but are presented in a different order and do not include some tracks included on Styx World: Live 2001. The DVD contains songs from Styx World: Live 2001 and two other previously released albums, Arch Allies: Live at Riverport (2001) and At the River's Edge: Live in St. Louis (2002), which contain songs recorded by Styx at a live performance in St. Louis, Missouri on June 9, 2000. The DVD contains two previously unreleased live recordings from that show, "Kiss Your Ass Goodbye" and "These Are the Times".
