Air Mobility Command (AMC) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the U.S. Air Force. It is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, east of St. Louis, Missouri.Air Mobility Command was established on June 1, 1992, and was formed from elements of the inactivated Military Airlift Command (MAC) and Strategic Air Command (SAC).  AMC melded MAC's worldwide airlift system of primarily C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter and C-130 Hercules airlift aircraft with SAC's tanker force of KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender aerial refueling aircraft, the latter aircraft having been freed from their strategic nuclear strike commitment to SAC's B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bomber fleet by the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
