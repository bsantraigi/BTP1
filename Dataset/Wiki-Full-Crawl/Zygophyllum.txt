Zygophyllum is the type genus of the flowering plant family Zygophyllaceae. The generic name is derived from the  Greek words  (zygon), meaning "double", and  (phyllon), meaning "leaf". It refers to the leaves, each of which have two leaflets. The genus is distributed in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, central Asia and Australia.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that as previously circumscribed, Zygophyllum was not monophyletic, and the genus was split among a number of other genera, including Augea, Fagonia, Roepera and Tetraena.
