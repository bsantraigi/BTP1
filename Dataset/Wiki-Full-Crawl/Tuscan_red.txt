Tuscan red is a shade of red that was used on the passenger cars of the Pennsylvania Railroad, as well as on the PRR TrucTrailers. It also was used extensively by the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia, in a similar fashion to the PRR. The Canadian Pacific Railway used it historically and painted its luxury revival cars in this color. It is also a Prismacolor colored pencil. 

The first recorded use of Tuscan red as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact date uncertain).The color was popular in the late 19th century but non-standardized. It became the signature color of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which instituted specifications for its formulation. Before the 1880s, pigments extracted from Brazil wood were used in its manufacture, but these proved inadequate in terms of hiding power and stability.A 1916 US National Bureau of Standards circular describes it as based on Indian red, which derives its color from iron oxides. The color was then modified by treatment with an alizarin lake pigment. The pigments stability lent itself to hard use in applications such as rail cars and machinery. Lower-cost imitations were made without iron oxides by using gypsum or whiting as a base and adding aniline dyes.
