WYME-CD is a Class A Antenna TV-affiliated television station licensed to Gainesville, Florida, United States. It broadcasts a low-powered standard definition digital signal on virtual and UHF channel 45 from a transmitter between I-75/SR 93 and US 441/SR 25 in rural Alachua County. Owned by New Age Media, WYME is a sister station to High Springs-licensed dual CBS/MyNetworkTV affiliate WGFL (channel 28) and Gainesville-licensed NBC affiliate WNBW-DT (channel 9). The latter is actually owned by MPS Media, LLC but operated by New Age Media through a local marketing agreement (LMA). All three stations are in turn operated by the Sinclair Broadcast Group under a master service agreement. The stations all share studios on Northwest 80th Boulevard (along I-75/SR 93) in Gainesville. 
Even though WYME-CD broadcasts a digital signal of its own, its broadcast range is limited to the immediate Gainesville area. However, it receives full-market over-the-air coverage via the fourth digital subchannel of WNBW. This signal broadcasts on virtual and VHF channel 9.4 from a transmitter in Newberry. On cable, WYME-CD can be seen on Cox digital channel 115 in Gainesville.
