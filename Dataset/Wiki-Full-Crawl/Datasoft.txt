Datasoft, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher founded in 1980 by Pat Ketchum. Based out of Chatsworth, California, Datasoft ported games from arcade systems to personal computers and acquired licenses for games from famous movies and TV shows. Some original titles were also produced.
Datasoft developed and published video games for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, PC, and Tandy Color Computer. The company went into bankruptcy and its name and assets were purchased by two Datasoft executives, Samuel L. Poole and Ted Hoffman.  They renamed the company IntelliCreations and distributed Datasoft games until it closed.
