Sadie G. Koninsky (August 1879  January 2, 1952) was an American composer, music publisher, and music teacher who lived most of her life in Troy, New York.  A prolific composer, she is thought to have authored over 300 pieces of music, including waltzes and marches.  "Eli Green's Cakewalk", which became a popular hit when it appeared in 1898, was also the first cakewalk published by a woman.  Some of her work was published under her male pseudonym, Jerome Hartman.
