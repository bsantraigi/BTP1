igo Urkullu Renteria (born 18 September 1961) is a Spanish politician from Alonsotegi, the Lehendakari of the Basque Government since 2012. Urkullu graduated in Teaching, specialized in Basque language, from the University of Deusto. He was the Basque Nationalist Party chairman from 2008 to 2013, when he was succeeded by Andoni Ortuzar since the party's rules do not allow a Lehendakari to be the party's chairman at the same time. 
He was the Biscay leader of the party from 2004 to 2008 and has been a member since 1996. He was the director of the Biscay foral Department for Youth and Social Services from 1987 to 1994 and served in the Basque Parliament from 1984 to 1987 and from 1994 to 2005 (during the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th sittings of the parliament).
