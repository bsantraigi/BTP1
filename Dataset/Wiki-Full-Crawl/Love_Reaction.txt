"Love Reaction" is the third single from the album The Story So Far by Divine. "Love Reaction" was recorded twice upon the suggestion of Divine's Dutch record company, the second version modeled after New Order's successful "Blue Monday" single. A suit was threatened against Bobby Orlando for audio plagiarism, but never materialized.
