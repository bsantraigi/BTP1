Total Wipeout (also known in other countries as Wipeout UK) is a British game show, hosted by Richard Hammond and Amanda Byram, which first aired on 3 January 2009. Each week, 20 contestants competed in a series of challenges in an attempt to win 10,000. These challenges were based in large pools of water or mud and generally involved large assault courses that participants had to cross. The 20 contestants are narrowed down to 12, then to either 6 or 5, with the final 3 progressing to the Wipeout Zone.
Total Wipeout was a licensed version of Wipeout, the Endemol show that originated in the United States in 2008, with the name slightly altered to avoid confusion with the BBC version of the earlier game show of the same name.
On 29 March 2012, the BBC confirmed that they would axe Total Wipeout after its sixth series. The Daily Mirror reported that a BBC spokesperson said: "After four very successful series of Total Wipeout, and one series of Winter Wipeout, the BBC has taken the decision that the next series, due to transmit later this year, will be the last." The remaining 10 episodes from Series 5 began airing on 18 August 2012 and ended the shows successful 4-year run on BBC One before 2013.
