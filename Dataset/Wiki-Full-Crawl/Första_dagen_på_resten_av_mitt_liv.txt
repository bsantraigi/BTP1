Frsta dagen p resten av mitt liv (English: "First day of the rest of my life") is a 2011 studio album by Swedish jazz singer Kikki Danielsson. Although Danielson continued recording studio albums with Roosarna during the 1990s, the album was the first released in her own name since 1993.
The album peaked at number 3 on the Swedish album chart during the first week of its release. In May 2011 the song "Wagon Wheels" received a Svensktoppen test, but failed to chart.
