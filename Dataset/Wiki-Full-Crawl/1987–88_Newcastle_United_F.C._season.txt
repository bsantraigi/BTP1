During the 198788 season, Newcastle United participated in the Football League First Division. Following the sale of star player Peter Beardsley to Liverpool for a club record fee of 1.9 million, manager Willie McFaul recruited Brazilian international Mirandinha to replace Beardsley. With the Brazilian joining Goddard and Paul Gascoigne, the team managed a mediocre start to the season. Midfielder Glyn Hodges arrived from Wimbledon but only managed seven games in his 86-day stay, before heading back south. McFaul signed young Irishman in the winter, hailed as a new George Best by some, the 18 year old went on an amazing run scoring 12 goals in 19 games that saw Newcastle finish 8th, their highest finish since being promoted back to the top flight.
