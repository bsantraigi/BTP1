Goa University was established under the Goa University Act of 1984 (Act No. 7 of 1984) and commenced operations on 1 June 1985. The university provides higher education in the Indian state of Goa.
The traditions of Goa University date back to the 17th century, with the creation of the first university courses by the Portuguese Empire. However, it was only after the annexation of Goa that the process was consolidated, with the University of Mumbai establishing a Centre of Post-Graduate Instruction and Research (CPIR) in Panaji. The CPIR offered affiliation to the first colleges that were instituted in Goa in June 1962. Since 1985, the Goa University took over the role of the CPIR. The University offers graduate and post-graduate studies and research programmes. It is currently (201419) accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council in India with a rating of A Grade.It is located on the Taleigo plateau and is one of India's few universities offering western languages such as Portuguese and French languages. The University's Department of Portuguese and Lusophone Studies is the only such in the entire Indian subcontinent.
