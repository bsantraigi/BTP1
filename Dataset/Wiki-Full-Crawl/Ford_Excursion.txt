The Ford Excursion is a heavy duty (Class 2), extended-length sport utility vehicle that was produced by Ford from 1999 to 2005, launched for 2000 in the North American market. The longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production, the Excursion was based upon the Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.  A 34-ton (0.68 t) chassis vehicle, the Ford Excursion was designed as a competitor for the 2500-series (also 34-ton) Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.Due to criticism of its large size, poor fuel economy, and declining sales, the Excursion was discontinued after the 2005 model year in the United States (Mexico received a short 2006 production run). For the 2007 model year, the Excursion was largely replaced as Ford introduced an extended-length version of the Ford Expedition (Expedition EL in United States; Expedition Max in Canada/Mexico), although it is only a Class 1 SUV.
All Excursions were assembled at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky; the last vehicle was produced September 30, 2005.
