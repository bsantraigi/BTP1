The Garifuna ( GAR-ee-FOO-n; pl. Garinagu in Garifuna) are an Amerindian ethnic group native to Central America who speak an eponymous Arawakan language. While they are ancestrally and genealogically descended from groups that migrated from the Lesser Antilles, mainly Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, many Garifuna today are of mixed ancestry, primarily with West African, Central African, Island Carib, European, and Arawak admixture.Most Garifuna people live along the Caribbean Coast of Honduras, with smaller populations in Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua. They arrived there after being exiled from the islands of the Lesser Antilles by British colonial administration as "Black Caribs" after a series of slave revolts. Those Caribs deemed to have had less African admixture were not exiled and are still present in the Caribbean. There is now also a large number that have moved to the United States.
