General Sir William Medows KB (31 December 1738  14 November 1813) was an Englishman and a general in the British Army. He entered the army in 1756 and saw action in North America, the Cape, and India. In 1788 he was appointed Governor of Bombay, transferring to become Governor of Madras in 1790.
That year, at the head of 15,000 men, he attacked Tipu Sultan of Mysore. In a see-saw campaign he was slightly wounded, mishandled a crucial assault and attempted suicide before the war ended in Britain's favour. In 1801 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ireland as a full general.
