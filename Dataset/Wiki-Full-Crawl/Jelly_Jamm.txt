Jelly Jamm is a Spanish-British 3D animated preschool television series created by Carlos L. Del Rey, Victor M. Lopez and David Cantolla. Jelly Jamm follows the adventures of seven characters: Bello, Goomo, Rita, Mina, Ongo, King and Queen; who live on a planet named 'Jammbo'. The planet has a music factory where all music in the universe originates from, and this music is produced continuously through bubbles. If this factory stopped, the characters would become suspended in a fixed position and be unable to move with no memory. The intention of Jelly Jamm is to "celebrate music, fun and friendship," and in each episode the characters interact with each other in various games and activities, learning morals and lessons. The show is aimed to kids 4 to 9 years old.
Jelly Jamm is a production of Vodka Capital and 737 SHAKER, two Spanish producers, based in Madrid and Segovia. The series is co-produced by RTVE, Japanese toy, action figure and video game company Bandai and home entertainment distributor BIGPICTURE.
