The Republican Federation (French: Fdration rpublicaine, FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orlanists rallied to the Republic.
Founded in November 1903, the party competed with the more secular and centrist Alliance dmocratique (Democratic Alliance). Later, most deputies of the Fdration rpublicaine and of Action librale (which included Catholics rallied to the Republic) joined the Entente rpublicaine dmocratique right-wing parliamentary group.
