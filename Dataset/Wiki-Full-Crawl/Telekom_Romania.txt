Telekom Romania (formerly known as Romtelecom and Cosmote Romnia) is a Romanian telecommunications company headquartered in Bucharest. It is the result of the brand merger between Romtelecom and Cosmote. Although it shares the branding of Deustche Telekom, the company is a subsidiary of OTE, a Greek telecommunications company (which is in turn minority-controlled by Deustche Telekom).
