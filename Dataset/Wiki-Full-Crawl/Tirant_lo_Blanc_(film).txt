Tirant lo Blanc (also known as The Maidens' Conspiracy) is a 2006 historical adventure film directed by Vicente Aranda and starring Casper Zafer, Esther Nubiola and Victoria Abril. The script was written by Aranda based on Tirant lo Blanch, a Valencian language chivalry novel dating to 1490, written by Joanot Martorell. It presents a highly fictionalized alternate history narrative of the events leading to the Fall of Constantinople.
