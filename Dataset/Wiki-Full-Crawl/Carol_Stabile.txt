Carol Stabile is a professor in the department of Womens Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park.In 2014, Stabile received an American Council of Learned Societies fellowship for her work on blacklisted (supposedly communist) and conservative women's involvement in 1940's and 1950's television industries. Her project "examines the forms of employment progressive women were seeking in the new industry, as well as the opposition they faced from anti-communist men and women opposed to viewpoints they considered un-American." Prior to the ACLS fellowship, Stabile's peer-reviewed academic article "The Typhoid Marys of the Left: Gender, Race, and the Broadcast Blacklist" received the 2013 Ronald D. and Gayla T. Farrar Award in Media and Civil Rights History.
