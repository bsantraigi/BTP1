"Motherless Children" is a blues standard first recorded by Blind Willie Johnson in 1927, and later popularised by such artists (inter alia) as Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Steve Miller, Eric Clapton, Rosanne Cash and Lucinda Williams.The song has an autobiographical theme, as Johnson's mother died when he was young. His father remarried soon after her death, and later the stepmother allegedly blinded the boy with lye after the father found her in flagrante delicto.
