"Message to Michael" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, that has been a hit for several different artists under several different titles.  The song was first recorded as "Message to Martha" by Jerry Butler in 1962.  In 1964, singer Lou Johnson had a minor US hit with the song, with the title "Kentucky Bluebird".  The British singer Adam Faith also recorded the song as "A Message to Martha (Kentucky Bluebird)" in 1965, and had a substantial hit with it in the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 12. Exactly the same recording was issued in Australia as "Message to Martha", where it was a No. 15 hit for Faith. Americans are probably most familiar with the 1966 Top Ten version by Dionne Warwick, which was titled "Message To Michael". 
In all versions of the song, the lyrics are addressed to a bluebird by the singer. The singer is in Kentucky, and his/her sweetheart is vainly pursuing musical stardom in New Orleans. The singer asks the bluebird to take a message to Martha/Michael, asking for the sweetheart to return.
