ehzade Cihangir (9 December 1531 27 November 1553) was the sixth and youngest child of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Hrrem Sultan. From birth, he had many health issues and developed a humped back. He was very well educated and said to be one of the cleverest of his siblings and half-siblings. Reports suggest that he later died of "grief" at the news of the execution of his elder half-brother, Mustafa, ordered by his father, Sultan Suleiman.
The Istanbul neighborhood of Cihangir was named after ehzade Cihangir when his father had Mimar Sinan build a wooden mosque there overlooking the Bosphorus to commemorate his death. The neighborhood's name comes from this mosque. 
In the television series Muhteem Yzyl, Cihangir is played by Turkish actor Tolga Sarta.
