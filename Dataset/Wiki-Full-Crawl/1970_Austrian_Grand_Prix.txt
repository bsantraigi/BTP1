The 1970 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the sterreichring on 16 August 1970. It was race 9 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. This was the third Austrian Grand Prix, the second as part of the World Championship, and the first at the scenic sterreichring, built to replace the bumpy and bland Zeltweg Airfield circuit.
The 60-lap race was won by Jacky Ickx, driving a Ferrari, after he started from third position. Teammate Clay Regazzoni achieved his first podium finish by coming second, while Rolf Stommelen achieved his only podium finish, coming third in a Brabham-Ford. Local driver and championship leader Jochen Rindt started from pole position in his Lotus-Ford, but retired with an engine failure.
