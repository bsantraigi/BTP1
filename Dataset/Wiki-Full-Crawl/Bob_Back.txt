Bob Back (26 May 1981  January 2011) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He won the Premio Tevere as a two-year-old and the Valdoe Stakes as a three-year-old, but reached his peak in 1985 when he won the Premio Presidente della Repubblica before recording a 33/1 upset win over a very strong field in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. He was later exported to race in the United States but failed to reproduce his European form, winning one minor race from fourteen attempts. He later became a successful breeding stallion, making his biggest impact as a sire of chasers and hurdlers.
