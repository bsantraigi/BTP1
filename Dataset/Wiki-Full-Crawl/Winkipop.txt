Winkipop (19071931) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse that won the 1910 1,000 Guineas Stakes and Coronation Stakes. She raced briefly at age four and was retired from racing in 1911. As a broodmare, she produced the good racers Plymstock and Blink before she was exported to the United States in 1927. Winkipop died in 1931 at the Mereworth Stud near Lexington, Kentucky.
