The 1987 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 20 September 1987. It was the twelfth round of the 1987 Formula One season. It was the 16th Portuguese Grand Prix and the fourth to be held at Estoril. The race was held over 70 laps of the 4.35-kilometre (2.7 mi) circuit for a race distance of 304.5 kilometres (189.2 mi).
The race was won by the reigning world champion, Frenchman Alain Prost driving a McLaren MP4/3. Prost finished 20 seconds ahead of Austrian driver Gerhard Berger driving a Ferrari F1/87. Nelson Piquet finished third driving a Williams FW11B. The win was Prost's 28th Grand Prix victory, eclipsing Jackie Stewart's all-time record. He also tied former McLaren teammate Niki Lauda's record with his 54th podium finish.
The race was marred by a multi-car collision on the opening lap. Piquet and Michele Alboreto (Ferrari F1/87) collided at the start with Derek Warwick (Arrows A10), Satoru Nakajima (Lotus 99T), Martin Brundle (Zakspeed 871), Christian Danner (Zakspeed 871), Philippe Alliot (Lola LC87), Ren Arnoux (Ligier JS29C) and Adrin Campos (Minardi M186) were all involved in the ensuing accident. Only Danner was unable to restart as the Zakspeed team had only one usable car which went to Brundle.
With Piquet finishing third ahead of both Mansell and Senna, Piquet expanded his championship points lead to 18 points over Senna and 24 over Mansell.
