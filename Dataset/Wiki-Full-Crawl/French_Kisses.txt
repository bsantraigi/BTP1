"French Kisses" is the second single by Jentina from her eponynomus debut album Jentina, only released in the UK and Ireland. It was written by Jentina and Cathy Dennis with an electro-hop/R&B vibe.
A music video was made for this song, where Jentina is in a club trying to kiss a boy during the whole video, but something always occurs and they don't kiss. The video was directed by Dawn Shadforth.
