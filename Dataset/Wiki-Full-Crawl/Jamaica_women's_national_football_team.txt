In 2008 the team was disbanded after they failed to get out of the group stage of Olympic Qualifying, which notably featured the United States and Mexico. The program was restarted in 2014 after nearly a six-year hiatus. They finished second at the 2014 Women's Caribbean Cup losing 10 against Trinidad and Tobago in the final. The team is backed by ambassador Cedella Marley, the daughter of the late Bob Marley, she aids in raising awareness for the team and encourages development as well as providing for it financially.
