Mooki River, a perennial stream that is part of the Namoi catchment within the MurrayDarling basin, is located in the Northern Tablelands district of New South Wales, Australia.
The river rises at the junction of Omaleah Creek and Phillips Creek, and forms below the Liverpool Range, south-west of Quirindi, and flows generally west of north, joined by three minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Namoi River north-east of Gunnedah; descending 88 metres (289 ft) over its 128 kilometres (80 mi) course.The towns of Quirindi and Werris Creek lie within the basin of the Mooki River, much of which is prime agricultural land. Little natural vegetation remains in the plains but river gums and other trees grow on the banks of the Mooki River. The Kamilaroi Highway and the North-west railway line cross the Mooki River near Breeza.
