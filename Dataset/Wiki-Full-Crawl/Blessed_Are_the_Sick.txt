Blessed Are the Sick is the second studio album from death metal band Morbid Angel. It features an overall slower musical sound, although containing very fast riffs, and reveals another side of the band, with classical music undertones (main composer Trey Azagthoth would dedicate this album to Mozart). Tracks 9, 10 and 12 are re-recorded songs from the 1986 demo Abominations of Desolation.
The album was recorded JanuaryFebruary 1991 at Morrisound Recording, Tampa, Florida; produced by Morbid Angel; engineered and mixed by Tom Morris.
The cover painting is "Les Trsors de Satan" by Jean Delville.
The album was reissued in 2009 as a Digipak in DualDisc format. The CD side contains the original audio release and the DVD side contains a one-hour documentary.
