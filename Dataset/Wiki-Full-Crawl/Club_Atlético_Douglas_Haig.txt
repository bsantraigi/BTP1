Club Atltico Douglas Haig is an Argentine football club from Pergamino, Buenos Aires Province.

Founded on 18 November 1918 after the victory of the Allied forces, a group of British workers on the Argentinian central railroad decided to start a club to participate in the local soccer championship. This required the consent and support of the chief of the railway, Ronald Leslie, who, as a condition, requested that the club take the name of General Douglas Haig.
