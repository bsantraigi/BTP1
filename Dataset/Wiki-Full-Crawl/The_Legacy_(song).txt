"The Legacy" is the fourth single by American rock band Black Veil Brides, and the second single from their second album Set the World on Fire.
It was leaked on YouTube May 29 from an online radio site. It is also their first charting single, peaking at #28 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song is about the band leaving a legacy that will change the world. As lead vocalist Andy put it, "In life, everyone wants to leave a legacy. This song is about when we first started touring together as a band and the absolute love and devotion we have received from the BVB Army. Together we have created something amazing. This will be our Legacy."
