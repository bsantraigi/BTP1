Associazione Calcio Femminile Trani 80 (198088) was a professional women's soccer team from  Trani in southern Italy. 
It won the Serie A (women's football) ("Scudetto") three times 198486 and the Coppa Italia in 1983.
Due to sponsorship, it underwent a series of name changes, before withdrawing from the league ahead of the 198889 season. It was not affiliated with the U.S. Calcio Trani men's team.
Playing as ACF Gusmai Trani the club won promotion from Serie B (Girone D) in their second season. In 1982 ACF Marmi Trani finished third in their first season at the top level. They finished second in the 1983 Serie A after losing a playoff to Alaska Lecce, but won the Coppa Italia by beating Tigullio 72 on penalty shoot out after a 11 draw.
In 1984 they merged with champions Alaska Lecce to become ACF Alaska Trani, inheriting Lecce's Scottish striker Rose Reilly. That season Trani won the league for the first time, then retained their title in 1985 as ACF Sanitas Trani. After becoming ACF Despar Trani for 198586 (following a sponsorship deal with Spar), the club secured a third title. Despar Trani finished second behind Lazio in 198687, as did the final incarnation of the club, ACF Trani B.K.V. in 198788.  The final owner B.K.V., a construction company, lost interest and the club ended.
Trani was defeated in the 1985 and 1988 Coppa Italia finals, by Lazio and Modena, respectively.
The team had many star players, including Carolina Morace. It retains a mythical quality due to its prominent place in the "golden era" of Italian women's football.
