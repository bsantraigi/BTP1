Annie Get Your Gun  1986 London Cast is an album from the first London revival of Irving Berlin's musical Annie Get Your Gun, starring American rock musician Suzi Quatro as Annie Oakley and Eric Flynn as Frank Butler. The revival was a David Gilmore Chichester Festival Theatre production. It toured in the UK and then moved to the Aldwych Theatre in London's West End.
The album was initially released on the First Night/Pinnacle record label as Annie Get Your Gun (1986 London revival cast) and is sometimes (ambiguously) called Annie Get Your Gun (Original London Cast Recording) or Annie Get Your Gun: Original London Cast Recording. It is Quatro's ninth studio album.
