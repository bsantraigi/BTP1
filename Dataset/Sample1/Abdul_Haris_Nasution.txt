The Great General DR. Abdul Haris Nasution Museum (officially known as Indonesian: Museum Sasmitaloka Jenderal Besar DR. Abdul Haris Nasution) is a museum in Jakarta, Indonesia. The museum showcases life, career and works of Great General Abdul Haris Nasution, the country's prominent military figure and the then Indonesian Armed Forces Chief of Staff who barely escaped capture and eventual assassination at the hands of the alleged communist coup movement in 1965.
The museum was originally the residence of Nasution and his family when he was the Indonesian Armed Forces Chief of Staff in 1949 until his death on 6 September 2000. On 30 September 1965, troops from the Cakrabirawa G30S/PKI attempted kidnapping and killing of Nasution. Nasution escaped the attempt, but in the event, his daughter Ade Irma Suryani Nasution and the First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean was murdered.
The museum houses a collection from Abdul Haris Nasution and some dioramas about the G-30-S PKI, 30 September 1965. The museum is open free to public from Tuesday until Sunday, from 08:00 WIB until 14:00 WIB.
