Adrian Mutu (Romanian pronunciation: [adrian mutu] (listen); born 8 January 1979) is a Romanian football coach and former player who is currently the reserve team coach at United Arab Emirates club Al Wahda. As a player, he played as an attacking midfielder or a forward. 
Mutu started his career in Romania playing two years for Arge Piteti and half a year for Dinamo Bucureti, before joining Internazionale in Italy midway through the 19992000 Serie A. After only 10 games with the Nerazzurri, he left for Hellas Verona and then Parma, for which he scored 39 goals in the next three years. His excellent form brought him a 22.5 million transfer to Chelsea. Due to breach of contract for failing a (recreational) drug test, he was released and returned to Serie A to join Juventus. After the 2006 Italian football scandal and the relegation of Juventus to Serie B, Mutu decided to join Fiorentina, where he played consistently for five years. He then had a season at Cesena and French club Ajaccio before returning to his native country with Petrolul Ploieti in 2014. After two more brief spells with Pune City and ASA Trgu Mure, Mutu retired from professional football in 2016.
From his international debut in 2000, Mutu played 77 matches for the Romanian national team and scored 35 goals, a joint record alongside Gheorghe Hagi. He was included in the country's squads at the European Championship in 2000 and 2008. A four-time winner of the Romanian Footballer of the Year award, only Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorghe Hagi have received the award more times, with six and seven wins respectively.
