Alfonso I (1073/1074  7 September 1134), called the Battler or the Warrior (Spanish: el Batallador), was the king of Aragon and Pamplona from 1104 until his death in 1134. He was the second son of King Sancho Ramrez and successor of his brother Peter I. With his marriage to Urraca, queen regnant of Castile, Len and Galicia, in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title Emperor of Spain, formerly employed by his father-in-law, Alfonso VI. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the Reconquista. He won his greatest military successes in the middle Ebro, where he conquered Zaragoza in 1118 and took Ejea, Tudela, Calatayud, Borja, Tarazona, Daroca, and Monreal del Campo. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the Muslims at the Battle of Fraga.
His nickname comes from the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of San Juan de la Pea (c. 1370), which says that "they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn't as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles" (clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas veni).
