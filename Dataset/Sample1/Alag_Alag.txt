Alag Alag is a 1985 Hindi film starring Rajesh Khanna, Tina Munim and Shashi Kapoor in the lead roles, produced by Rajesh Khanna and directed by one of his favourite directors Shakti Samanta. The film is best remembered for the way it was shot in Kashmir, and its different storyline. It was inspired by the Pakistani movie Meherbani, which was produced by Parvez Malik in 1982. In 1992, Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that it was in this film that Munim showed the "first sparks" of the dedicated actress she would become.Kishore Kumar did not accept any money from Rajesh Khanna for rendering the songs of this film. When Khanna asked why he would not accept, Kumar replied that he had got a fresh lease of life as a singer with Aradhana (1969) and since this was Khanna's first film as producer, he had no right to accept any money.
