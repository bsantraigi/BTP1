Anurodh (English: Request) is a 1977 Hindi musical drama film, based on the 1963 Bengali film Deya Neya, produced by Girija Samanta and directed by Shakti Samanta. The film stars Rajesh Khanna,  Vinod Mehra, Simple Kapadia, Rita Bhaduri, Ashok Kumar, Asrani, Asit Sen Utpal Dutt and Nirupa Roy. The music of the film is by Laxmikant Pyarelal. The movie revolves around a rich city boy (played by Khanna), who aspires to be a musician against his father's wishes and assumes a different identity to sing for a radio station, while his songs are written by a poor friend (played by Mehra)
Pyarelal quoted in an interview "Rajesh Khanna had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta's Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had had some misunderstanding with Pancham then and did not want to work with him." Director Shakti Samanta said that although the film had an "interesting story", he felt that audiences didn't want to accept the leading man, Rajesh Khanna, doing romantic scenes with his real-life wife Dimple Kapadia's sister Simple Kapadia and this is the reason this film was just a superhit otherwise it would have been a bigger blockbuster.
