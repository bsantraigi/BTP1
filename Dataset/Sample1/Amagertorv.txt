Amagertorv (English: Amager Square), today part of the Strget pedestrian zone, is often described as the most central square in central Copenhagen, Denmark. Second only to Gammeltorv, it is also one of the oldest, taking its name from the Amager farmers who in the Middle Ages came into town to sell their produce at the site.
Now the square is a central junction in the heart of Copenhagen, dominated by its Stork Fountain and a number of buildings, the oldest of which dates back to 1616. In opposite directions, Strget extends towards Kongens Nytorv and the City Hall Square, the two largest squares in Copenhagen, to the northwest Kbmagergade leads to Nrreport, the busiest railway station in Denmark, and to the southeast Hjbro Plads connects to Slotsholmen across Hjbro Bridge, and from there onwards to Christianshavn and Amager on the other side of the harbour.
The paving is from 1993 and was designed by Bjrn Nrgaard. It consists of a pattern of pentagonal granite stones in five colours.
