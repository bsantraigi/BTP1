Adam Martin Wyant (September 15, 1869   January 5, 1935) was an American politician who served as Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. He served six terms, a total of 12 years, in the House. However Wyant is also best remembered for being the first professional football player to be elected to the United States Congress. From 1895 until 1897, Wyant played football with the Greensburg Athletic Association, an early professional club from Greensburg, Pennsylvania.
He is also known for playing collegiate football for Bucknell University and the University of Chicago from 1890 through 1893. During his playing career, Wyant was cited by his coach at Chicago, Amos Alonzo Stagg, as one of the best men that ever donned the canvas jacket (which was then a part of the football uniform). Wyant also served at one time as principal of the Greensburg schools before becoming a U.S. Congressman. His brother, Andy, played at Bucknell and Chicago, under Amos Alonzo Stagg. He was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1962.
