Anselme Gatan Desmarest (March 6, 1784  June 4, 1838) was a French zoologist and author. He was the son of Nicolas Desmarest and father of Eugne Anselme Sbastien Lon Desmarest. Desmarest was a disciple of Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, and in 1815, he succeeded Pierre Andr Latreille to the professorship of zoology at the cole nationale vtrinaire d'Alfort.  In 1820 he was elected to the Acadmie Nationale de Mdecine.
Desmarest published Histoire Naturelle des Tangaras, des Manakins et des Todiers (1805), Considrations gnrales sur la classe des crustacs (1825), Mammalogie ou description des espces des Mammifres (1820) and Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles (181630, with Andr Marie Constant Dumril).
The brown algae Desmarestia is named in honour of Desmarest, as well as the family (Desmarestiaceae)  and in turn, the order (Desmarestiales)  of which the genus is the type species.
