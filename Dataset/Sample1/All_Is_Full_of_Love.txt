"All Is Full of Love" is a song by Icelandic musician Bjrk from her third studio album Homogenic (1997). The lyrics were inspired by love in spring and Ragnark of Norse mythology. Bjrk's original version is a trip hop ballad with soul influences, harp, strings, and electronic beats; the version on Homogenic is a minimalist remix by Howie B, emphasising Bjrk's vocals. A remix by the German IDM duo Funkstrung was released as a single in 1998.
In 1999, "All Is Full of Love" was released as a single with a music video directed by Chris Cunningham. The video uses Bjrk's original mix, and depicts Bjrk as a robot being assembled in a factory, who passionately kisses another robot. The video is often cited as one of the best of all time and a milestone in computer animation; it has been displayed in art exhibitions and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The single reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and became a dance hit in the United States. 
"All Is Full of Love" is the opening track on Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were voted for by fans. It has been covered by various artists.
