Alix Le Clerc (2 February 1576  9 January 1622), known as Mother Alix, was the foundress of the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Congregation of Our Lady (French: Notre-Dame), a religious order founded to provide education to girls, especially those living in poverty. They opened Schools of Our Lady throughout Europe. Offshoots of this Order brought its mission and spirit around the globe. She was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1947.
