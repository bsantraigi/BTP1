Her granddaughter, Ana, a very sweet and intelligent 10-year-old, also has been affected by the death: She has been rendered virtually speechless by the trauma, though she expresses herself through music and possesses an extraordinary ability to move objects with her mind. Ana's unscrupulous father, Francisco Capistrn, however, has taken advantage of the situation to try to steal Julia's school.
The timely arrival of Ana's uncle, Salvador, Amanda and her adopted son changes everything. Anas sad and lonely life takes an unexpected turn for the better and she regains her joy in a series of adventures bursting with humor, excitement, music and thrilling surprises.
