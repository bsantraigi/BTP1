The line provides an airport rail link from Suvarnabhumi Airport, via Makkasan Station, to Phaya Thai station in central Bangkok. Most of the line is on a viaduct over the main eastern railway. It is owned by State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and operated by the consortium of Charoen Pokphand Holding and partners, the consortium group of Charoen Pokphand Holding (CP), Ch. Karnchang PLC. (CK), Bangkok Expressway and Metro PLC. (BEM), Italian-Thai Development PLC. (ITD) and China Railway Construction Corporation Limited (CRCC). The 28.6 kilometers (17.8 mi) Airport Rail Link opened for service on 23 August 2010.  Services originally consisted of both express services and the City Line, a commuter rail service with eight stations. However since September 2014, all express services have been suspended indefinitely due to a shortage of rolling stock availability.
