Aurora Sutra was a Dark Wave band that was formed in Hamburg, Germany by Patricia Nigiani and Peter Spilles, both members of Project Pitchfork. They began recording under the name Aurora, but added the "Sutra" after the release of their debut The Land of Harm and Appletrees in 1993. In 1995 Peter Spilles returned his focus to Project Pitchfork, with Patricia Nigiani continuing the Aurora musical project until 1998.
