A Fazenda (Portuguese pronunciation: [a fzd], English: The Farm)  is a Brazilian reality television game show based on the Swedish television series of the same name that was originally created in 2001 by Strix and produced in association with Sony Entertainment and Endemol. The series premiered on Sunday May 31, 2009 at 9:30 p.m. on RecordTV.The show is based on a group of celebrities living together twenty-four hours a day in a Farm (located in Itu during first eight seasons, and in Itapecerica da Serra since season nine), isolated from the outside world (primarily from mass media, such as newspapers, telephones, television and the internet) while having all their steps followed by cameras around-the-clock, with no privacy for three months.The contestants compete for the chance to win the grand prize by avoiding weekly eviction, until the last celebrity remains at the end of the season that can claim the grand prize. The show was originally presented by news reporter Britto Junior, a position he held throughout the first seven seasons. Roberto Justus later replaced Britto as the host of the series from the eighth season onwards.
Since 2010, the subscription-based live feeds are available directly through R7.com. In order to preserve the drama for television broadcasts, RecordTV does not webcast certain moments that transpire in the house, including weekly competitions.
