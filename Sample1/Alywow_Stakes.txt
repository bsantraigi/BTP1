The Alywow Stakes is a Canadian Thoroughbred horse race run annually during the second week of June at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. Open to three-year-old fillies, the overnight stakes race is contested on turf over a distance of six and one half furlongs.
Inaugurated in 2002, the race is named for the filly Alywow who died that year. Alywow was the 1994 Canadian Champion Three-Year-Old Filly and Horse of the Year. She was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2009.
