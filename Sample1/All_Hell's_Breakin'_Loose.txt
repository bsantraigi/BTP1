"All Hell's Breakin' Loose" is a song by American hard rock band Kiss, that appeared on their 1983 album Lick It Up. It was the second and final single released from the album and did not chart in the US."All Hell's Breakin' Loose" is one of three songs in the history of the band in which all four (current at the time) members share songwriting credit, the others being "Love Theme from KISS" (from the self-titled album) and "Back to the Stone Age" (from Monster).
A video for the single was directed by Martin Kahan and produced by Lenney Grodin that featured the band wandering around a burnt-out cityscape amongst thugs, bikers, scantily-clad women, circus performers, and other odd characters. The video received some air play on MTV, and was nominated for a MTV video music award in 1984.
The song also appears on The Box Set, released by Kiss in 2001.
During their tenure in Continental Championship Wrestling, the Stud Stable used the song as their entrance theme.
