Legio Urbana is the self-titled debut album by Brazilian rock band Legio Urbana. It was released on 1 January 1985.
Though the band was not a punk outfit, their first album shows the influence of British punk bands from the same time period, particularly single "Gerao Coca-Cola", whose fast-paced acoustic guitar rhythm is heavily reminiscent of Buzzcocks.  The album was not successful as whole upon release, but it spawned several hit singles, namely "Ser", "Ainda  Cedo" and "Gerao Coca-Cola". Synthesizer-laden ballad "Por Enquanto" is one of the band's most covered songs, as is "Ser".
In 2007, the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone magazine elected Legio Urbana as the 40th greatest Brazilian album of all time.The artwork on the album cover was designed by drummer Marcelo Bonf.
