Asfalt Records is a Polish independent record label specialized in hip-hop music. It was founded in 1998 by Marcin "Tytus" Grabski. In July 1998, Asfalt Records signed a three-year distribution deal with Sony Music Entertainment Poland. The first album released by Asfalt Records was the debut of Polish group OMP Wilanw... zobacz rnic, which was released on December 16, 1998. Afterwards, two groups, RHX and Pomie 81 joined the label. In June 1999, the label released a 12" single Otzafszetu/Oempe, which was most likely to be the first hip-hop record released in such format. In February 2001, Grabski founded a sub-label Teeto Records that was supposed to release hip-hop-related records.
In April 2007, album Hollyd by O.S.T.R. was certified as gold record. It was the first Asfalt's record, which reached that status. The first platinum record was also O.S.T.R.'s album Tylko dla dorosych, released in 2010.
