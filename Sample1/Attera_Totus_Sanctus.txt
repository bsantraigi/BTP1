Attera Totus Sanctus (intended Latin translation of "Destroy All the Holy") is Dark Funeral's fourth full-length studio album. It was released on October 24, 2005, in Europe through Regain Records, and on November 29, 2005, in the United States through Candlelight Records USA. The title was chosen to convey the band's vehement antiRight-Hand Path  stance. Attera Totus Sanctus is the first album to feature guitarist Chaq Mol and the last album to feature drummer Matte Modin and also features session bassist Gustaf Hielm.
